# Time & Timeout & Timer & Ticker

## 1. Introduction

Usually, in our programs, we need to deal with datetime. The golang has a convenient built-in *time* package for us to use, it provides us many methods to operate the *time* struct. The *timeout*, *timers* and *tickers* are commonly used to timed tasks with channels and goroutines. This experiment will give you a tour to them.

### 2.1 Time

Go offers extensive support for time and duration. To use `time` , firstly `import time` to include the standard time package. Here are some examples. We’ll start by getting the current time. You can build a `time` struct by providing the year, month, day, etc. Times are always associated with a `Location`, i.e. time zone. You can extract the various components of the time value as expected. The `Sub` methods returns a `Duration` representing the interval between two time. We can compute the length of the duration in various units. You can use `Add` to advance a time by a given duration, or with a `-` to move backwards by a duration.

```
package main

import "fmt"
import "time"

func main() {
    
    p := fmt.Println
    
    // get the current time
    now := time.Now()
    p(now)
    
    // specify a time in this way
    then := time.Date(
        2009, 11, 17, 20, 34, 58, 651387237, time.UTC)
    p(then)
    
    // you can output each field of the time struct separately
    p(then.Year())
    p(then.Month())
    p(then.Day())
    p(then.Hour())
    p(then.Minute())
    p(then.Second())
    p(then.Nanosecond())
    p(then.Location())
    
    // user the method to get weekday of today
    p(then.Weekday())
    
    // compare two time
    p(then.Before(now))
    p(then.After(now))
    p(then.Equal(now))
    
    // get the `Duration` between two time
    diff := now.Sub(then)
    p(diff)
    
    // output `Duration` in different format
    p(diff.Hours())
    p(diff.Minutes())
    p(diff.Seconds())
    p(diff.Nanoseconds())
    
    // establish a new time with the `Duration`
    p(then.Add(diff))
    p(then.Add(-diff))
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run time.go

### 2.2 Timeout

*Timeout* is important for programs that connect to external resources or that otherwise need to bound execution time. Implementing timeout in Go is easy and elegant thanks to *channels* and `select`. For our example, suppose we’re executing an external call that returns its result on a channel `c1` after 2s. Here’s the `select` implementing a timeout. `res := <-c1`awaits the result and `<-Time.After` awaits a value to be sent after the timeout of 1s. Since `select` proceeds with the first receive that’s ready, we’ll take the timeout case if the operation takes more than the allowed 1s. If we allow a longer timeout of 3s, then the receive from `c2`will succeed and we’ll print the result. Running this program shows the first operation timing out and the second succeeding. Using this `select` timeout pattern requires communicating results over channels. 

```
package main

import "time"
import "fmt"

func main() {

	// make a buffered channel
	c1 := make(chan string, 1)
	// in a new goroutine, wait for 2 seconds 
	// and send a message to the channel
    go func() {
        time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
        c1 <- "result 1"
    }()
    
    fmt.Println("wait 1 second...")
    // first as channel `c1`,`time.After` is not ready, 
    // so blocked here waiting for them to get ready, 
    // after 1 second, the second case is ready and select it
    select {
        case res := <-c1:
            fmt.Println(res)
        case <-time.After(1 * time.Second):
            fmt.Println("timeout 1")
    }
    
    // make another buffered channel
    c2 := make(chan string, 1)
    // in a new goroutine, wait for 2 seconds 
	// and send a message to the channel
    go func() {
        time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
        c2 <- "result 2"
    }()
    
    fmt.Println("wait 2 seconds...")
    // first as channel `c2`,`time.After` is not ready, 
    // so blocked here waiting for them to get ready, 
    // after 2 second, the first case is ready and select it
    select {
        case res := <-c2:
            fmt.Println(res)
        case <-time.After(3 * time.Second):
            fmt.Println("timeout 2")
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run timeout.go 
wait 1 second...
timeout 1
wait 2 seconds...
result 2
```

This is a good idea in general, because other important Go features are based on channels and `select`. We’ll look at two examples of this next: timers and tickers.

### 2.3 Timer

We often want to execute Go code at some point in the future, or repeatedly at some interval. Go’s built-in *timer* and *ticker* features make both of these tasks easy. Timers represent a single event in the future. You tell the timer how long you want to wait, and it provides a channel that will be notified at that time. This timer will wait 2 seconds.

```
package main

import "time"
import "fmt"

func main() {

	// create a new timer of 2 seconds
	timer1 := time.NewTimer(2 * time.Second)
	
	fmt.Println("wait 2 seconds...")
	// the channel `timer1.C` will get ready after 2 seconds
	// so it will blocks here waiting for 2 seconds
	<-timer1.C
	fmt.Println("Timer 1 expired")

	// create another timer of 1 second
	timer2 := time.NewTimer(time.Second)
	// in a new goroutine, wait for the `timer2.C` channel to get ready
	go func() {
		<-timer2.C
		fmt.Println("Timer 2 expired")
	}()
	// we stop the `timer2` immediately,and terminate the `timer2` goroutine
	stop2 := timer2.Stop()
	if stop2 {
		fmt.Println("Timer 2 stopped")
	}
}
```

The `<-timer1.C` blocks on the timer's channel `C` until it sends a value indicating that the timer expired. If you just wanted to wait, you could have used `time.Sleep`. One reason a timer may be useful is that you can cancel the timer before it expires. As the example shows. The first timer will expire ~2s after we start the program, but the second should be stopped before it has a chance to expire.

**Output:**

```
$ go run timer.go
wait 2 seconds...
Timer 1 expired
Timer 2 stopped
```

### 2.4 Ticker

*Timers* are for when you want to do something once in the future - *tickers* are for when you want to do something repeatedly at regular intervals. Tickers use a similar mechanism to timers: a channel that is sent values. Here we’ll use the built-in `range` on the channel to iterate over the values as they arrive every 1000ms. Tickers can be stopped like timers. Once a ticker is stopped it won’t receive any more values on its channel. We’ll stop ours after 3800ms. Here’s an example of a ticker that ticks periodically until we stop it. 

```
package main

import "time"
import "fmt"

func main() {

	// create a new ticker of 1000ms
	ticker := time.NewTicker(1000 * time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Println("start ticking...")
	// in a new goroutine, range over the `ticker` value
	go func() {
		for t := range ticker.C {
			fmt.Println("Tick at", t)
		}
	}()

	// wait for 3800ms in the main goroutine
	time.Sleep(3800 * time.Millisecond)
	// then stop the ticker and terminate `ticker` goroutine
	ticker.Stop()
	fmt.Println("Ticker stopped")
}
```

When we run this program the ticker should tick 3 times before we stop it. Be careful about the ticker and use the `Stop` to explicitly end it if no need to use it, otherwise it may cause goroutine leaks.

**Output:**

```
$ go run ticker.go
start ticking...
Tick at 2018-02-28 10:45:10.3130059 +0800 CST m=+1.014116301
Tick at 2018-02-28 10:45:11.3170662 +0800 CST m=+2.018176601
Tick at 2018-02-28 10:45:12.3161651 +0800 CST m=+3.017275501
Ticker stopped
```

## 3. Summary

Now, you have already known how to deal with datetime and how to design a timer and ticker. To make use of them, you must have good understanding with the goroutines and channels. Only combinating them with Go's concurrency will reveal their  great power.
