# Error & Panic & Recover & Defer 

## 1. Introduction

In this lab, we introduce some helpful skills of Go, the error handle, panic and recover, defer. The program does not always do what we want. Sometimes, conditions out of out control may occur in which case the programs gives you some unexpected results, such as resources are unavailable, network is down, the computer io errors, sudden power off, etc. To resolve these problems, you can use Go's built-in error, panic & recover and defer.

### 2.1 Error

In Go, it's idiomatic to communicate errors via an explicit, separate return value. This contrasts with the exceptions used in languages like Java and Ruby and the overloaded single result / error value sometimes used in C. Go's approach makes it easy to see which functions return errors and to handle them using the same language constructs employed for any other, non-error tasks. By convention, errors are the last return value and have type `error`, a built-in interface which has a method `Error`. The method `errors.New` constructs a basic `error` value with the given error message.  

```
package main

import "errors"
import "fmt"

// define a function with two return values
// the second returns an built-in error value
func f1(arg int) (int, error) {
    if arg == 42 {
    	// retirn an integer and set message for error
    	return -1, errors.New("can't work with 42")
    }
    return arg + 3, nil
}

// define a coustom error type with two fields
// an error number, an error message
type argError struct {
    arg  int
    prob string
}

// the custom error type has a method `Error`
// return fields info in string
// if one implements the error interface, it is type of error
func (e *argError) Error() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%d - %s", e.arg, e.prob)
}

// this is a variant on the example above 
// that uses a custom type to explicitly represent an argument error.
// define a function, return an integer and a custom error
func f2(arg int) (int, error) {
    if arg == 42 {
    	// return an error number and a custom error reference
    	return -1, &argError{arg, "can't work with it"}
    }
    return arg + 3, nil
}

func main() {
	
	// test for return normal error
	for _, i := range []int{7, 42} {
        if r, e := f1(i); e != nil {
            fmt.Println("f1 failed:", e)
        } else {
            fmt.Println("f1 worked:", r)
        }
    }
    
    // test for return custom error
    for _, i := range []int{7, 42} {
        if r, e := f2(i); e != nil {
            fmt.Println("f2 failed:", e)
        } else {
            fmt.Println("f2 worked:", r)
        }
    }
    
    _, e := f2(42)
    // use type assertion to identify and convert to a custom error type
    if ae, ok := e.(*argError); ok {
        fmt.Println(ae.arg)
        fmt.Println(ae.prob)
    }
}
```

A `nil` value in the error position indicates that there was no error. It's possible to use custom types as `error`s by implementing the `Error()` method on them. In this case we use `&argError` syntax to build a new struct, supplying values for the two fields `arg` and `prob`. The two loops test out each of our error-returning functions. Note that the use of an inline error check on the `if` line is a common idiom in Go code. If you want to programmatically use the data in a custom error, you'll need to get the error as an instance of the custom error type via type assertion. See this [great post](http://blog.golang.org/2011/07/error-handling-and-go.html) on the Go blog for more on error handling.

**Output:**

```
$ go run errors.go
f1 worked: 10
f1 failed: can't work with 42
f2 worked: 10
f2 failed: 42 - can't work with it
42
can't work with it
```

### 2.2 Defer

*Defer* is used to ensure that a function call is performed later in a program's execution, usually for purposes of cleanup or free resources. `defer` is often used where e.g. `ensure` and `finally`would be used in other languages. Suppose we wanted to create a file, write to it, and then close when we're done. Here's how we could do that with `defer`.

```
package main

import "fmt"
import "os"

func main() {
	
	// to create a file
	f := createFile("/tmp/defer.txt")
	
	// the function will execute when main ends
    defer closeFile(f)
    
    // write some content into file
    writeFile(f)
}

// create a file and return a file handler
func createFile(p string) *os.File {
    fmt.Println("creating")
    f, err := os.Create(p)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    return f
}

// write some string into a file
func writeFile(f *os.File) {
    fmt.Println("writing")
    fmt.Fprintln(f, "data")
}

// after operating to a file, close it, free the resource
func closeFile(f *os.File) {
    fmt.Println("closing")
    f.Close()
}
```

Immediately after getting a file object with `createFile`, we defer the closing of that file with `closeFile`. This will be executed at the end of the enclosing function (`main`), after`writeFile` has finished.

**Output:**

```
$ go run defer.go
creating
writing
closing
```

The defer has some advantages, you can add functionality without changing the programs structure. The defer statement can be anywhere in the program, it only executes when the block ends.

### 2.3 Panic & Recover

A `panic` typically means something went unexpectedly wrong. `panic` will lead to a runtime error, and we can perform it with `recover`. Mostly we use it to fail fast on errors that shouldn't occur during normal operation, or that we aren't prepared to handle gracefully. You shold use it carefully, it's not very friendly to users. We'll use panic throughout to check for unexpected errors. A common use of panic is to abort if a function returns an error value that we don't know how to (or want to) handle. Here's an example of `panic`king if we get an unexpected error when creating a new file.

```
package main

import "os"

func main() {
    
    // cause a panic artificially
    panic("a problem")
    
    // this would be never execute
    // because panic will abort program execution
    _, err := os.Create("/tmp/file")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run panic.go
panic: a problem

	
goroutine 1 [running]:
main.main()
	/.../panic.go:7 +0x40
...
exit status 2
```

Running this program will cause it to panic, print an error message and goroutine traces, and exit with a non-zero status. Note that unlike some languages which use exceptions for handling of many errors, in Go it is idiomatic to use error-indicating return values wherever possible.

Sometimes, when a panic happens, we do not want to end the execution, you can recover from a `panic `using `recover` , the `recover` is usually combinated with `defer` so as to perform the functionality. Here's an example showing you how to use it.
```
package main

import "fmt"
import "os"

func main() {
    // cause a panic artificially
    panic("a problem")
    
    // program can be recover from the first panic
    // and continue to execute after where panic occurs
    // but when the second panic occurs, the program aborts
    defer func() {
      	str := recover()
      	fmt.Println(str)
    }()
    
    // this would be execute after recover from first panic
    _, err := os.Create("/file")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run recover.go
panic: a problem

goroutine 1 [running]:
main.main()
	.../recover.go:8 +0x40
```

## 3. Summary

All this lab dealing with exceptions, you should be careful for them. The errors handling in golang is simple. Using defer, you can delay the execution of a method to the end, so you will not forget do some necessary performance. With panic and recover, you can abort your program or make some conduction.
