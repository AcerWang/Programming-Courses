# Structs & Interfaces

## 1. Introduction

In this lab, you are going to learn two very important parts of Go: *structs and interfaces*. The built-in data types are very convenient and powerful, but not always. Sometimes, you need some data structures to operate some specific tasks and the built-in types can not meet your demands. Luckily, the structs give you the power, you can define your own data structures as you like. The interfaces in Go is maybe one of the most outstanding features that  make golang simple and powerful, the interface type is contrasted to the concrete types we have already learnt, it's a more abstract notion. Let's start right now.

### Learning Objective

- pointers
- structs
- methods
- interfaces

### 2.1 Structs
#### 2.1.1 Pointers

Go supports *pointers*, allowing you to pass references to values and records within your program. An pointer point to the location in memory where the real value or record is stored. Pointers operation are safe in Go, and the GC will automatically maintain variables and reference for us, you can use them feeling free.

```
// here are two ways to declare a pointer
int i = 1

// use *typename to indicate a pointer
var ptr1 *int
ptr1 = &i

// use built-in `new(typename)`, it will return a pointer of typename
var ptr2 = new(int)
```

 We’ll show how pointers work in contrast to values with 2 functions: `zeroval` and `zeroptr`. The operator `&` is used to get the address of a variable or record,  the operator `*` is used to access the value or record of a pointer.

```
package main
	
import "fmt"

// this function has an integer parameter
// which means parameter is passed by value
func zeroval(ival int) {
	// `ival` is a local variable
	// it does not modify the original variable
    ival = 0
}

// this function has a pointer parameter point to an integer
// which means parameter is passed by reference
func zeroptr(iptr *int) {
	// set the value of pointer `iptr` refers to
	// it will change original variable
	// *iptr indicates the value of `iptr` refers to
    *iptr = 0
}

func main() {
	
	// after `zeroval` callled, `i` is still the same as before
    i := 1
    fmt.Println("initial:", i)
    zeroval(i)
    fmt.Println("zeroval:", i)
    
    // after `zeroptr` called, `i` is changed
    // &i gets the address of `i`
    zeroptr(&i)
    fmt.Println("zeroptr:", i)
    // the address of `i` is printed in hexadecimal
    // it's not all the same on different machines
    fmt.Println("pointer:", &i)
}
```

`zeroval` has an `int` parameter, so arguments will be passed to it by value. `zeroval` will get a copy of `ival` distinct from the one in the calling function. `zeroptr` in contrast has an `*int` parameter, meaning that it takes an `int` pointer. The `*iptr` code in the function body then *dereferences* the pointer from its memory address to the current value at that address. Assigning a value to a dereferenced pointer changes the value at the referenced address. The `&i` syntax gives the memory address of `i`, i.e. a pointer to `i`. Pointers can be printed too. `zeroval` doesn’t change the `i` in `main`, but `zeroptr` does because it has a reference to the memory address for that variable.

**Output:**

```
$ go run pointers.go
initial: 1
zeroval: 1
zeroptr: 0
pointer: 0xc04200a128
```

#### 2.1.2 Structs

Go’s *structs* are typed collections of fields. They’re useful for grouping data together to form records. The way to create a new struct. 

```
// `type` define a new type
// `Person` is the new type name
// `struct` indicates Person is a struct
type person struct {
	// there are two data fields `name` and `age`
  	name string
    age  int
}

// declare new struct type variable `p1`
// `p1` is by default a zero-valued variable
var p1 person

// `new` will return a pointer,
// and allocate memory for the struct and init it
// `p2` is a pointer point to a Person struct
var p2 = new(person)
```



This `person` struct type has `name` and `age` fields. You can name the fields when initializing a struct. Omitted fields will be zero-valued. An `&` prefix yields a pointer to the struct. Access struct fields with a dot. You can also use dots with struct pointers - the pointers are automatically dereferenced. Structs are mutable.

```
package main

import "fmt"

// define a new struct type
type person struct {
	// field `name` is a  string
    name string
    // field `age` is an integer
    age  int
}

func main() {
	
	// init a new Person struct with fields values
	fmt.Println(person{"Bob", 20})
	
	// init a new Person struct with both fields names and values
	fmt.Println(person{name: "Alice", age: 30})
	
	// init only one of Person's fields, other fields will be zero-valued
	fmt.Println(person{name: "Fred"})
	
	// print the reference to a Person struct, that is the address
	fmt.Println(&person{name: "Ann", age: 40})
	
	// access Person's field `name` by `.` operator
	s := person{name: "Sean", age: 50}
    fmt.Println(s.name)
    
    // this has the same effect with the upper one
    sp := &s
    fmt.Println(sp.age)
    
    // update Person's field `age` value
    sp.age = 51
    fmt.Println(sp.age)
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run structs.go
{Bob 20}
{Alice 30}
{Fred 0}
&{Ann 40}
Sean
50
51
```

Structs also can be embedded  into another struct, thus our code can be simplified. Here is an example:

```
package main

import "fmt"

// define a new struct type 
type data struct {
  x, y int
}
// define a new struct type
type person struct {
	// field `name` is a  string
    name string
    // field `age` is an integer
    age  int
}

// create a composing type `student`
type student struct {
	// here we embed `person` struct into this
	// the new struct has `person` fields
	// this is an anonymous field, only struct type given
  	person
  	// this is not an anonymous field, given a name
  	d data
  	sid string
}

func main() {
  	
  	var stu = student{ person{"Ann",18}, data{5, 10}, "1001"}
  	// for an anonymous field, we can get the inner field like this
  	fmt.Println(stu.name)
  	// for non-anonymous field, get the inner field like this
  	fmt.Println(stu.d.x)
  	
}
```

**Output:**

```Ann
$ go run embedded-struct.go
Ann
5
```

Since golang does not have concept of class, if you want to perform OOP paradigm, how can you do it? Next we'll learn methods on structs, with them, you can easily realize something similar to class in other programming languages.

#### 2.1.3 Methods

Go supports *methods* defined on struct types. Methods can be defined for either pointer or value receiver types. Add a receiver between keyword `func` and function  name,  then you finish adding a method to a struct. Here’s an example of a receiver. The `area` method has a receiver pointer type of `*rect`. The `perim` method has a receiver struct type of `rect`. Here we call the 2 methods defined for our struct. Go automatically handles conversion between values and pointers for method calls. You may want to use a pointer receiver type to avoid copying on method calls or to allow the method to mutate the receiving struct. 

```
package main

import "fmt"

// define a new struct type
type rect struct {
    width, height int
}

// use a pointer to `rect` as a receiver
func (r *rect) area() int {
    return r.width * r.height
}

// use a struct `rect` as a receiver
func (r rect) perim() int {
    return 2*r.width + 2*r.height
}

func main() {
	
	// init a new struct `rect` with values
    r := rect{width: 10, height: 5}
    
    // call the methods by struct variable
    fmt.Println("area: ", r.area())
    fmt.Println("perim:", r.perim())
    
    // call the methods by pointer to struct
    rp := &r
    fmt.Println("area: ", rp.area())
    fmt.Println("perim:", rp.perim())
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run methods.go
area:  50
perim: 30
area:  50
perim: 30
```

Next we’ll look at Go’s mechanism for grouping and naming related sets of methods: interfaces.

### 2.4 Interfaces

*Interfaces* are named collections of method signatures, no details of methods are provided in interface. Interfaces in golang are not like those in other languages, you don't need to implement them explicitly, they are implicitly completed when some structs have all the methods in the interfaces. We use the syntax to create an interface:

```
type name interface { 
	// methods signatures
	// ...
}
```
 Here’s a basic interface for geometric shapes called *geometry* . For this example, we’ll implement the interface on `rect`and `circle` types. To implement an interface in Go, we just need to implement all the methods in the interface. Here we implement `geometry` on `rect`s. If a variable has an interface type, then we can call methods that are in the named interface. Here’s a generic `measure` function taking advantage of this to work on any `geometry`. The `circle` and `rect` struct types both implement the `geometry` interface so we can use instances of these structs as arguments to `measure`. To learn more about Go’s interfaces, check out this [great blog post](http://jordanorelli.tumblr.com/post/32665860244/how-to-use-interfaces-in-go).

```
package main

import "fmt"
import "math"

// define an interface with two empty methods
type geometry interface {
    area() float64
    perim() float64
}

// define a struct type with two fields
type rect struct {
    width, height float64
}

// define a struct type with one field
type circle struct {
    radius float64
}

// the struct `rect` implements interface `geometry`
func (r rect) area() float64 {
    return r.width * r.height
}
func (r rect) perim() float64 {
    return 2*r.width + 2*r.height
}

// the struct `rect` implements interface `geometry`
func (c circle) area() float64 {
    return math.Pi * c.radius * c.radius
}
func (c circle) perim() float64 {
    return 2 * math.Pi * c.radius
}

// any type of `geometry` can be processed
func measure(g geometry) {
    fmt.Println(g)
    fmt.Println(g.area())
    fmt.Println(g.perim())
}

func main() {

	// init a `rect` and `circle` object
    r := rect{width: 3, height: 4}
    c := circle{radius: 5}
    
    // since the two  structs implement all the methods in the interface
    // they are also become type of geometry
    // so they can be passed as parameters to `measure`
    measure(r)
    measure(c)
}
```

![](6.png)

By implementing the interface, the `rect` and `circle`  have a particular  relationship with the interface `geometry` ,  something like *is-a* 

**Output:**

```
$ go run interfaces.go
{3 4}
12
14
{5}
78.53981633974483
31.41592653589793
```

Like structs, interfaces also can be embedded ones into another.

## 3. Summary

By now, you have a basic understanding of structs and interfaces not very in-deep. Especially the interface is distinct, only with more practice can you get into the essence.
