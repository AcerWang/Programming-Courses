# Arrays & Slices & Maps & Range

## 1. Introduction

In the first lab, you learned some simple basic data types such as numbers, boolean. In this lab, we introduce some advanced data types (sometimes called composite types or collection types) which are commonly used in golang. Golang provides many useful methods to manipulate these data structures. They can meet most of  our demand. With them, you can improve your efficiency immensely.

### 2.1 Arrays

In golang, an *array* is a numbered sequence of elements of a specific length. Here we create an array `a` that will hold exactly 5 `int` numbers. The type of elements and length are both part of the array’s type. By default an array is zero-valued, which for `int`s means `0`s. We can set a value at an index using the `array[index] = value` syntax, and get a value with `array[index]`. The builtin `len` returns the length of an array. Array types are one-dimensional, but you can compose types to build multi-dimensional data structures. Note that arrays appear in the form `[v1 v2 v3 ...]` when printed with `fmt.Println`. 
```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    // here we create an array `a` that  hold 5 integers
    // by default, the array is zero-valued, which for `int`s means `0`s.
    var a [5]int
    fmt.Println("emp:", a)
    
    // set a value at an index 4.
    a[4] = 100
    fmt.Println("set:", a)
    // get a value at an index 4.
    fmt.Println("get:", a[4])
    
    // the builtin `len` returns the length of an array.
    fmt.Println("len:", len(a))
	
    // use this syntax to declare and initialize an array in one line.
    // b := [...]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is the same as below,
    // the ellipsis `...` indicates the length of array is determined by the
    // numbers of the initializers.
    b := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    fmt.Println("dcl:", b)
  	
  	// four cities in the array, set three of them but the first one
  	// in the braces, the `index:value` is used to set item value at location index
  	cities := [...]string{1: "\"Beijing\"", 2: "\"New York\"", 3: "\"Tokyo\""}
  	fmt.Println(len(cities),"cities:",cities)
  	
    // the upper case, we created a one-dimensional array
    // you can create multi-dimensional data structures like this.
    var twoD [2][3]int
    for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < 3; j++ {
            twoD[i][j] = i + j
        }
    }
    fmt.Println("2d: ", twoD)
}
```
**Output:**

```
$ go run array.go
emp: [0 0 0 0 0]
set: [0 0 0 0 100]
get: 100
len: 5
dcl: [1 2 3 4 5]
4 cities: [ "Beijing" "New York" "Tokyo"]
2d:  [[0 1 2] [1 2 3]]
```

You’ll see *slices* much more often than arrays in typical Go. We’ll look at slices next.

### 2.2 Slices

*Slices* are a key data type in Go, giving a more powerful interface to sequences than arrays. Unlike arrays, slices are typed only by the elements they contain (not the number of elements). To create an empty slice with non-zero length, we can use the built-in `make`.  There are four ways to create a slice:

```
// the built-in make will return a reference to slice
make([]Type, length, capacity)
make([]Type, length)

// this is some like definition of array
// but the difference is not to determine the length in square brackets
[]Type{}
[]Type{value1, value2, …, valueN}
```

Here we make a slice of `string`s of length `3` (initially zero-valued). We can set and get just like with arrays. `len` returns the length of the slice as expected. In addition to these basic operations, slices support several more that make them richer than arrays. One is the builtin `append`, which returns a slice containing one or more new values. Note that we need to accept a return value from `append` as we may get a new slice value. Slices can also be `copy`’d. Here we create an empty slice `c`of the same length as `s` and copy into `c` from `s`. Slices support a “slice” operator with the syntax `slice[low:high]`, any operation on the sliced slice will affect the whole slice as they are an entirety . For example, s[2:5] this gets a slice of the elements `s[2]`, `s[3]`, and `s[4]`, this slices up to (but excluding) `s[5]`, and including) `s[2]`. Slices can be composed into multi-dimensional data structures. The length of the inner slices can vary, unlike with multi-dimensional arrays.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    // use builtin `make` to create a slice of
    // `string`s of length `3` (initially zero-valued).
    s := make([]string, 3)
    fmt.Println("emp:", s)
    
    // we can set and get just like with arrays.
    s[0] = "a"
    s[1] = "b"
    s[2] = "c"
    fmt.Println("set:", s)
    fmt.Println("get:", s[2])
    
    // `len` returns the length of the slice as expected.
    fmt.Println("len:", len(s))
    
    // slices support several more operations than arrays.
    // the builtin `append`, which returns a slice 
    // containing one or more new values.
    // we use variable `s` to accept return value from `append`
    s = append(s, "d")
    s = append(s, "e", "f")
    fmt.Println("apd:", s)
    
    // the built-in `copy` copys content
    // into `c` from `s`.
    c := make([]string, len(s))
    copy(c, s)
    fmt.Println("cpy:", c)
    
    // slices support a "slice" operator of `slice[low:high]`.
    // this will get the elements `s[2]`, `s[3]`, and `s[4]`.
    l := s[2:5]
    fmt.Println("sl1:", l)
    
    // this slices up to (but excluding) `s[5]` from index 0.
    l = s[:5]
    fmt.Println("sl2:", l)
    
    // this slices up from (and including) `s[2]` to index len(s)-1.
    l = s[2:]
    fmt.Println("sl3:", l)
    
    // if the second item in slice l is changed
    // the origin slice s is changed
    // because they are an entirety actually
    l[1] = "o"
    fmt.Println("l:",l)
    fmt.Println("s:",s)
    
    // declare and initialize a slice in a single line.
    t := []string{"g", "h", "i"}
    fmt.Println("dcl:", t)
    
    // if you want to append another slice to a slice
    // you can use append like this
    // the ellipsis `...` indicates t is a slice
    s = append(s, t...)
	fmt.Println("s:",s)
    
    // slices can be composed into multi-dimensional data structures.
    // the length of the inner slices can vary,
    // unlike with multi-dimensional arrays.
    twoD := make([][]int, 3)
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        innerLen := i + 1
        twoD[i] = make([]int, innerLen)
        for j := 0; j < innerLen; j++ {
            twoD[i][j] = i + j
        }
    }
    fmt.Println("2d: ", twoD)
}
```
**Output:**

```
$ go run slice.go
emp: [  ]
set: [a b c]
get: c
len: 3
apd: [a b c d e f]
cpy: [a b c d e f]
sl1: [c d e]
sl2: [a b c d e]
sl3: [c d e f]
l: [c o e f]
s: [a b c o e f]
dcl: [g h i]
s: [a b c o e f g h i]
2d:  [[0] [1 2] [2 3 4]]
```

### 2.3 Maps

*Maps* are Go’s built-in associative data type (sometimes called *hashes* or *dicts* in other languages). To create an empty map, use the built-in `make`: `make(map[key-type]val-type)`. Set key/value pairs using typical `name[key] = val` syntax. Printing a map with e.g. `fmt.Println` will show all of its key/value pairs. Get a value for a key with `name[key]`. The builtin `len` returns the number of key/value pairs when called on a map. The builtin `delete` removes key/value pairs from a map. The optional second return value when getting a value from a map indicates if the key was present in the map. This can be used to disambiguate between missing keys and keys with zero values like `0` or `""`. Here we didn’t need the value itself, so we ignored it with the *blank identifier* `_`. You can also declare and initialize a new map in the same line with this syntax. Note that maps appear in the form `map[k:v k:v]` when printed with `fmt.Println`.
```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	
	// define x as map type and set it refer to a map
	// you can not do like this:
	// var x map[string]string
	// x["USA"] = "America"
	// map should initialized before use it, or you'll get a run-time error
	var x map[string]string = map[string]string{"USA": "America", "RPC": "China"}
	x["JPN"] = "Japan"
	fmt.Println("x:", x)
	
    // to create an empty map, key is type of string, value is type of int.
    m := make(map[string]int)
    
    // set key/value pairs.
    // for an exsisted key, the `map[key] = value` expression
    // will update the value for the key.
    m["k1"] = 7
    m["k2"] = 13
    
    // print a map with `fmt.Println`, this will show all of
    // its key/value pairs.
    fmt.Println("map:", m)
    
    // get a value for a key.
    v1 := m["k1"]
    fmt.Println("v1: ", v1)
    
    // the builtin `len` returns the number of key/value pairs
    fmt.Println("len:", len(m))
    
    // the builtin `delete` removes key/value pairs from a map.
    delete(m, "k2")
    fmt.Println("map:", m)
    
    // when getting a value from a map, it returns two value
    // the first is value corresponding to the key,
    // the second indicates whether the key exsists in the map
    // here we don't need the value itself,
    // so we ignor it with the identifier `_`.
    _, prs := m["k2"]
    fmt.Println("prs:", prs)
    
    // declare and initialize a new map in the same line.
    n := map[string]int{"foo": 1, "bar": 2}
    fmt.Println("map:", n)
}
```
**Output:**

```
$ go run map.go 
x: map[USA:America RPC:China JPN:Japan]
map: map[k1:7 k2:13]
v1:  7
len: 2
map: map[k1:7]
prs: false
map: map[foo:1 bar:2]
```

The output order of map varys as maps are unordered collection of key/value paires, this is a little different from arrays and slices. 

### 2.4 Range

`range` iterates over elements in a variety of data structures. Let’s see how to use `range` with some of the data structures we’ve already learned. Here we use `range` to sum the numbers in a slice. Arrays work like this too. `range` on arrays and slices provides both the index and value for each entry. as we don’t need the index, so we ignor it with the blank identifier `_`. Sometimes we actually want the indexes though. `range` on map iterates over key/value pairs. `range` can also iterate over just the keys of a map. `range` on strings iterates over Unicode code points. The first value is the starting byte index of the `rune` and the second is the `rune` itself.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
 
    nums := []int{2, 3, 4}
    sum := 0
    // we use `range` to iterate the slice nums.
    // arrays work like this too.
    // as we don't need the index, so we ignor it with `_`. 
    for _, num := range nums {
        sum += num
    }
    fmt.Println("sum:", sum)
    
    // `range` on arrays and slices provides both the
    // index and value for each entry. 
    for i, num := range nums {
        if num == 3 {
            fmt.Println("index:", i)
        }
    }
    
    kvs := map[string]string{"a": "apple", "b": "banana"}
    // `range` on map iterates over key/value pairs.
    for k, v := range kvs {
        fmt.Printf("%s -> %s\n", k, v)
    }
    
    // `range` can also iterate over just the keys of a map.
    for k := range kvs {
        fmt.Println("key:", k)
    }
    
    // `range` on strings iterates over Unicode code
    // points. The first value is the starting byte index
    // of the `rune` and the second the `rune` itself.
    // if you want, you can use string(c) to convert rune to char
    for i, c := range "go" {
        fmt.Println(i, c)
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run range.go
sum: 9
index: 1
a -> apple
b -> banana
key: a
key: b
0 103
1 111
```

## 3. Summary

So far, you have already learnt three more data types and some useful methods to handle them. And the `range` is very helpful, which is usually used with the `for` loop to iterate iterable objects.
