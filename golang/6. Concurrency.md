### 2.1 Goroutines

A *goroutine* is a lightweight thread of execution. Suppose we have a function call `f(s)`. Here’s how we’d call that in the usual way, running it synchronously. To invoke this function in a goroutine, use `go f(s)`. This new goroutine will execute concurrently with the calling one. You can also start a goroutine for an anonymous function call. Our two function calls are running asynchronously in separate goroutines now, so execution falls through to here. This `Scanln` requires we press a key before the program exits. When we run this program, we see the output of the blocking call first, then the interleaved output of the two goroutines. This interleaving reflects the goroutines being run concurrently by the Go runtime. Next we’ll look at a complement to goroutines in concurrent Go programs: channels.

```
package main
	
import "fmt"

func f(from string) {
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        fmt.Println(from, ":", i)
    }
}

func main() {

	 f("direct")
	 
	 go f("goroutine")
	 
	 go func(msg string) {
        fmt.Println(msg)
    }("going")
    
    fmt.Scanln()
    fmt.Println("done")
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run goroutines.go
direct : 0
direct : 1
direct : 2
goroutine : 0
going
goroutine : 1
goroutine : 2
<enter>
done
```

### 2.2 Channels

*Channels* are the pipes that connect concurrent goroutines. You can send values into channels from one goroutine and receive those values into another goroutine. Create a new channel with `make(chan val-type)`. Channels are typed by the values they convey. *Send* a value into a channel using the `channel <-` syntax. Here we send `"ping"` to the `messages` channel we made above, from a new goroutine. The `<-channel` syntax *receives* a value from the channel. Here we’ll receive the `"ping"` message we sent above and print it out. When we run the program the `"ping"` message is successfully passed from one goroutine to another via our channel. By default sends and receives block until both the sender and receiver are ready. This property allowed us to wait at the end of our program for the `"ping"` message without having to use any other synchronization.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	messages := make(chan string)
	
	go func() { messages <- "ping" }()
	
	msg := <-messages
    fmt.Println(msg)
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run channels.go 
ping
```

#### 2.2.1 Channel Buffering

By default channels are *unbuffered*, meaning that they will only accept sends (`chan <-`) if there is a corresponding receive (`<- chan`) ready to receive the sent value. *Buffered channels* accept a limited number of values without a corresponding receiver for those values. Here we `make` a channel of strings buffering up to 2 values.  Because this channel is buffered, we can send these values into the channel without a corresponding concurrent receive. Later we can receive these two values as usual.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  	
  	messages := make(chan string, 2)
  	
  	messages <- "buffered"
    messages <- "channel"
    
    fmt.Println(<-messages)
    fmt.Println(<-messages)
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run channel-buffering.go 
buffered
channel
```



#### 2.2.2 Channel Synchronization

We can use channels to synchronize execution across goroutines. Here’s an example of using a blocking receive to wait for a goroutine to finish. This is the function we’ll run in a goroutine. The `done`channel will be used to notify another goroutine that this function’s work is done. Send a value to notify that we’re done.  Start a worker goroutine, giving it the channel to notify on. Block until we receive a notification from the worker on the channel. If you removed the `<- done` line from this program, the program would exit before the `worker` even started.

```
package main

import "fmt"
import "time"

func worker(done chan bool) {
  	fmt.Print("working...")
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
    fmt.Println("done")
    
    done <- true    
}

func main() {

  	done := make(chan bool, 1)
    go worker(done)
    
    <-done
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run channel-synchronization.go      
working...done 
```

#### 2.2.3 Channel Directions

When using channels as function parameters, you can specify if a channel is meant to only send or receive values. This specificity increases the type-safety of the program. This `ping` function only accepts a channel for sending values. It would be a compile-time error to try to receive on this channel. The `pong` function accepts one channel for receives (`pings`) and a second for sends (`pongs`).

```
package main

import "fmt"

func ping(pings chan<- string, msg string) {
    pings <- msg
}

func pong(pings <-chan string, pongs chan<- string) {
    msg := <-pings
    pongs <- msg
}

func main() {
    pings := make(chan string, 1)
    pongs := make(chan string, 1)
    ping(pings, "passed message")
    pong(pings, pongs)
    fmt.Println(<-pongs)
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run channel-directions.go
passed message
```

### 2.3 Select

Go’s *select* lets you wait on multiple channel operations. Combining goroutines and channels with select is a powerful feature of Go. For our example we’ll select across two channels. Each channel will receive a value after some amount of time, to simulate e.g. blocking RPC operations executing in concurrent goroutines. We’ll use `select` to await both of these values simultaneously, printing each one as it arrives. We receive the values `"one"` and then `"two"` as expected. Note that the total execution time is only ~2 seconds since both the 1 and 2 second `Sleeps` execute concurrently.

```
package main

import "time"
import "fmt"

func main() {

	c1 := make(chan string)
    c2 := make(chan string)
    
    go func() {
        time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
        c1 <- "one"
    }()
    
    go func() {
        time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
        c2 <- "two"
    }()
    
    for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
        select {
        case msg1 := <-c1:
            fmt.Println("received", msg1)
        case msg2 := <-c2:
            fmt.Println("received", msg2)
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ time go run select.go 
received one
received two

real	0m2.245s
```

### 2.4 Non-Blocking Channel Operations

Basic sends and receives on channels are blocking. However, we can use `select` with a `default` clause to implement *non-blocking* sends, receives, and even non-blocking multi-way `select`s. Here’s a non-blocking receive. If a value is available on `messages` then `select` will take the `<-messages` `case` with that value. If not it will immediately take the `default` case. A non-blocking send works similarly. Here `msg` cannot be sent to the `messages` channel, because the channel has no buffer and there is no receiver. Therefore the `default` case is selected. We can use multiple `case`s above the `default` clause to implement a multi-way non-blocking select. Here we attempt non-blocking receives on both `messages` and `signals`.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    messages := make(chan string)
    signals := make(chan bool)
    
    select {
    case msg := <-messages:
        fmt.Println("received message", msg)
    default:
        fmt.Println("no message received")
    }
    
    msg := "hi"
    select {
    case messages <- msg:
        fmt.Println("sent message", msg)
    default:
        fmt.Println("no message sent")
    }
    
    select {
    case msg := <-messages:
        fmt.Println("received message", msg)
    case sig := <-signals:
        fmt.Println("received signal", sig)
    default:
        fmt.Println("no activity")
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run non-blocking-channel-operations.go 
no message received
no message sent
no activity
```

### 2.5 Closing Channels

*Closing* a channel indicates that no more values will be sent on it. This can be useful to communicate completion to the channel’s receivers. In this example we’ll use a `jobs` channel to communicate work to be done from the `main()` goroutine to a worker goroutine. When we have no more jobs for the worker we’ll `close` the `jobs` channel. Here’s the worker goroutine. It repeatedly receives from `jobs` with `j, more := <-jobs`. In this special 2-value form of receive, the `more` value will be `false` if `jobs` has been `close`d and all values in the channel have already been received. We use this to notify on `done` when we’ve worked all our jobs. This sends 3 jobs to the worker over the `jobs` channel, then closes it. We await the worker using the synchronization approach we saw earlier. The idea of closed channels leads naturally to our next example: `range` over channels.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    
    jobs := make(chan int, 5)
    done := make(chan bool
    
    go func() {
        for {
            j, more := <-jobs
            if more {
                fmt.Println("received job", j)
            } else {
                fmt.Println("received all jobs")
                done <- true
                return
            }
        }
    }()
    
    for j := 1; j <= 3; j++ {
        jobs <- j
        fmt.Println("sent job", j)
    }
    close(jobs)
    fmt.Println("sent all jobs")
    
    <-done
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run closing-channels.go 
sent job 1
received job 1
sent job 2
received job 2
sent job 3
received job 3
sent all jobs
received all jobs
```

### 2.6 Range over Channels

In a previous example we saw how `for` and `range` provide iteration over basic data structures. We can also use this syntax to iterate over values received from a channel. We’ll iterate over 2 values in the `queue` channel. This `range` iterates over each element as it’s received from `queue`. Because we `close`d the channel above, the iteration terminates after receiving the 2 elements. This example also showed that it’s possible to close a non-empty channel but still have the remaining values be received.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	queue := make(chan string, 2)
    queue <- "one"
    queue <- "two"
    close(queue)
    
    for elem := range queue {
        fmt.Println(elem)
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run range-over-channels.go
one
two
```
