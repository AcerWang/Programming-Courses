# Copy and Assignment

## 1. Introduction

In this lab, we'll implement the copy and assignment of smart pointer class by implementing the copy constructor function and evaluation operator.

#### Learning Objectives

- Implement the copy constructor function
- Implement assignment operator.

#### Experiment Environment

- Xfce terminal
- Vim
- g++

#### Target Learners

This course is suitable for learners with primary object-oriented programming in c++.

#### Source code

```sh
$ wget https://labexfile.oss-us-west-1-internal.aliyuncs.com/courses/91/smartpointer_sample.tar.gz
$ tar -xvf smartpointer_sample.tar.gz -C /home/labex/Code
```

### 2.1 Common uses of pointers

Let's check out the other common uses of pointer

```cpp
// Create an empty smart pointer first, and assign it.
SmartPointer<SomeClass> spclass1 = NULL;
spclass1 = new SomeClass;

// Create another smart pointer and point to the same memory resource of the previous pointer
SmartPointer<SomeClass> spclassother = spclass1;

// Create a smart pointer and use anthor smart pointer to assign the created one.
SmartPointer<SomeClass> spclass2 = new SomeClass;
spclass2 = spclass1;
```

How do we implement smart pointer by these uses? we demand the implementation of `copying constructor` and `assignment operator` in the smart pointer. For pointers, copy and assignment means share the pointed resources. In the implementation of smart pointer, it means the members of `mPointer` point to the same memory resource.

By default, C++ compiler would generate the implementation of `copying constructor` and `assignment operator` for the defined class. However, for our  smart pointer, using the  implementation of  `assignment operator` generated by the system by default will cause a problem. Let's assume we have the code below:

```c++
{  // Statement blo
  SmartPointer<SomeClass> spclass1 = new SomeClass; //1
  SmartPointer<SomeClass> spclass2 = new SomeClass; //2
  spclass2 = spclass1;      //3 Invoke the assignment operator
}
```

So, as the statement block executes, we hope the `new` objectives from `code 1` and `code 2` should be released automatically by smart pointers. However, if we use the the  implementation of  `assignment operator` generated by the system by default, the `new` object will never be released. But the `new` object will be released twice.

So we need to implement `assignment operator` by ourselves. And the`copying constructor` always come with it, let's implement them together.

### 2.2 Define the Prototype of Constructor and Assignment Operator

First, let's define the prototype of the constructor and assignment operator:

```cpp
// Headfile：smartpointer.h
template <typename T>  // Define the smart operator as class template
class SmartPointer {
public:
// ....
    // Copy consructor
    SmartPointer(const SmartPointer &other);     
    // assignment operator
    SmartPointer &operator = (const SmartPointer &other); 
// ....
};
```

There are two problem to deal with while implementing the assignment operator:

1. Release the underlying pointer.

   The problem is the reason why we need to implement the assignment operator by ourselves. Our solution is, before assign a new value to the underlying pointer, release the former one.

   ```c++
   if (mPointer) delete mPointer;  
   mPointer = other.mPointer; 
   ```

2. self assignment

   This is the so-called self assignment

   ```c++
   SmartPointer<SomeClass> spclass = new SomeClass;
   spclass = spclass; // We might think: who would write a stupid code like this lol.
   ```

   This `self assignment` would cause a problem in our solution to Problem 1. In the self assignment, `mPointer` and `other.mPointer` would point to the same memory object. So according to the solution to   Problem 1, our smart pointer will point to the same released memory.

   We use a classic resolution to solve this self assignment problem, which is `if (this == &other) return *this;`. Refer to *Effective c++* for more detail about `self assignment`.

   

### 2.3  Implement Smart Pointer 2

Implementation code(smartpointer.h), create file `smartpointer.h` in `/home/labex`：

```cpp
/* 
* file name : smartpointer.h
* desp : Smart pointer v2
*/
#ifndef __SMARTPOINTER_H__
#define __SMARTPOINTER_H__

template <typename T>  // Define the smart pointer as class template
class SmartPointer {
public:
    // The construnctor by default
    SmartPointer():mPointer(NULL) {std::cout <<"Create null smart pointer."<< std::endl;}    
    // Receive the constructor with different pointer type
    SmartPointer(T *p):mPointer(p) {std::cout <<"Create smart pointer at "<<static_cast<const void*>(p)<<std::endl;}     
    // The destructor
    ~SmartPointer(){
        std::cout << "Release smart pointer at "<<static_cast<const void*>(mPointer)<<std::endl;
        // Implement the automatical destroying mechanism of the memory resource
        if (mPointer) delete mPointer;
    }
    // Copy constructor 
    SmartPointer(const SmartPointer &other):mPointer(other.mPointer) {
        std::cout <<"Copy smart pointer at "<<static_cast<const void*>(other.mPointer)<<std::endl;
    }     
   // Assignment                
   SmartPointer &operator = (const SmartPointer &other) {
        // Deal with the problem of self assignment
        if (this == &other) return *this;
        // Deal with the problem of release of the underlying pointers
        if (mPointer) delete mPointer;
        mPointer = other.mPointer;  
        std::cout <<"Assign smart pointer at "<<static_cast<const void*>(other.mPointer)<<std::endl;
        return *this;
   } 
  
private:
    T *mPointer; // Points to the memory resource that the smart pointer actually corresponds to.Then define the pointer type of the internal resource, according to the automatical derivation rule of parameters.
};
#endif // __SMARTPOINTER_H__
```

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/smartpointer.h
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "smartpointer.h" in "/home/labex/"!
  timeout: 2
```

### 2.4 Test

Create test file `sptestcase2.cpp` in `/home/labex`：

```cpp
/* 
* file name : sptestcase2.cpp
* desp : Test code case2 :Test the copy and assignment of smart pointer
*/

#include <iostream>
#include "smartpointer.h"
class SomeClass{
public:
    SomeClass(){std::cout << "SomeClass default constructor !"<<std::endl;}
    ~SomeClass(){std::cout << "SomeClass deconstructor !"<<std::endl;}
};

void testcase2(void)
{
    // Create an empty smart pointer first, and assign it.
    SmartPointer<SomeClass> spclass1 = new SomeClass;
    std::cout << std::endl;
    // Self assignment
    spclass1 = spclass1;
    std::cout << std::endl;
    
    // Create another smart pointer and point to the same memory resource of the previous pointer
    SmartPointer<SomeClass> spclassother = spclass1;
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Create a smart pointer and use anthor smart pointer to assign the created one.
    SmartPointer<SomeClass> spclass2 = new SomeClass;
    std::cout << std::endl;
    spclass2 = spclass1;
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

int main(void)
{
    testcase2();
    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run：

```sh
$ g++ -o sptestcase2 sptestcase2.cpp
$ ./sptestcase2
```

The result：

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/sptestcase2.cpp
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "sptestcase2.cpp" in "/home/labex/"!
  timeout: 2
```

## 3. Summary

From the result, we can avoid the leak of the object resource when multiple smart pointers share the underlying resource, by implementing assignment operator and copy constructor. However, there's still a question while releasing the smart pointer: When multiple smart pointers execute he same underlying resource and release, every pointer would release the underlying resource. As a result, there's a `double free` bug. Check out the next experiment to solve this problem.
