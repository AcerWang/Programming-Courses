# Control Structures

## 1. Introduction

In the last lab, we learned values and variables and some other basic syntax. Let's move forward to control structures in golang. Typically, you'll learn the loop expression, the is-else expression and the switch expression, and these three structures are in some way different from those in other languages. Pay extra attention that there is no `while` expression in golang. 

#### Learning Objectives

- for loop
- if-else
- switch

### 2.1 for loop

`for` is Go's only looping construct. Here are three basic types of `for` loops. The most basic type, with a single condition. A classic initial/condition/after `for` loop using semicolon to seperate each expression. `for` without a condition will loop repeatedly until you `break` out of the loop or `return` from the enclosing function. You can also `continue` to the next iteration of the loop. We'll see some other `for` forms later when we look at `range`statements, channels, and other data structures. Write the following code in `for.go` in `/home.labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    // the most basic type, with a single condition.
    i := 1
    for i <= 3 {
        fmt.Println(i)
        i = i + 1
    }
    
    // a classic initial/condition/after 'for' loop.
    for j := 7; j <= 9; j++ {
        fmt.Println(j)
    }
    
    // 'for' without a condition will loop repeatedly
    // until you 'break' out of the loop or 'return' from
    // the enclosing function.
    for {
        fmt.Println("loop")
        break
    }
    
    // you can also 'continue' to the next iteration of the loop.
    for n := 0; n <= 5; n++ {
        if n%2 == 0 {
            continue
        }
        fmt.Println(n)
    }
}
```

Since there is no `while ` expression in golang, the `for` loop is rather flexible with three ways of representation, which is a novel programming pattern unlike other languages.

**Output:**


```
$ go run for.go
1
2
3
7
8
9
loop
1
3
5
```

    grep -i 'for' /home/labex/Code/for.go
  error: Oops, we find that you didn't use "for" loop in "for.go".
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.2 if-else

Branching with `if` and `else` in Go is straight-forward. Here's a basic example. You can have an `if` statement without an else. A statement can precede conditionals; any variables declared in this statement are available in all branches. Note that you don't need parentheses around conditions in Go, but that the braces are required. There is no ternary if in Go, so you'll need to use a full `if` statement even for basic conditions. Write the following code in `if-else.go` in `/home.labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    // the classic if-else expression
    if 7%2 == 0 {
        fmt.Println("7 is even")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("7 is odd")
    }
    
    // you can have an if statement without an else.
    if 8%4 == 0 {
        fmt.Println("8 is divisible by 4")
    }
    
    // in if statement, there is an assignment expression 
    // use a semicolon to seperate with conditional expression 
    // in nested conditionals, any variables declared in first if statement
    // are available in all branches.
    if num := 9; num < 0 {
        fmt.Println(num, "is negative")
    } else if num < 10 {
        fmt.Println(num, "has 1 digit")
    } else {
        fmt.Println(num, "has multiple digits")
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run if-else.go 
7 is odd
8 is divisible by 4
9 has 1 digit
```

  error: Oops, we find that you didn't use "if/else" structure in "if-else.go".
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.3 switch

`switch` statements express conditionals across many branches. Here's a basic `switch`. You can use commas to separate multiple expressions in the same `case` statement. The `switch` statement can have one more optional expression using semicolon to seperate with the conditional. We use the optional `default` case in this example as well. `switch` without an expression is an alternate way to express if/else logic. Here we also show how the `case`expressions can be non-constants. A type `switch` compares types instead of values. You can use this to discover the type of an interface value. In this example, the variable `t` will have the type corresponding to its clause. Write the following code in `switch.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.
```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "time"

func main() {

    i := 2
    fmt.Print("Write ", i, " as ")
    
    // `switch` with mutiple cases, values in case expressions are const
    switch i {
    case 1:
        fmt.Println("one")
    case 2:
        fmt.Println("two")
    case 3:
        fmt.Println("three")
    }
    
    // there's an assignment expression in the `switch` statement
    // this is similar with the case in if-else
    // the scope of n is limited within the `switch` block
    switch n := "y" ; n {
    case "y":
        fmt.Println("Yes")
    case "n":
    	fmt.Println("No")
    default:
    	fmt.Println("Error")
    }
    
    // you can use commas to separate multiple expressions
    // in the same `case` statement. We use the optional
    // `default` case in this example as well.
    switch time.Now().Weekday() {
    case time.Saturday, time.Sunday:
        fmt.Println("It's the weekend")
    default:
        fmt.Println("It's a weekday")
    }
    
    // `switch` without an expression is an alternate way
    // to express if/else logic. Here we also show how the
    // `case` expressions can be non-constants.
    t := time.Now()
    switch {
    case t.Hour() < 12:
        fmt.Println("It's before noon")
    default:
        fmt.Println("It's after noon")
    }
    
    // a type `switch` compares types instead of values
    // you can use this to discover the type of an interface value
    // in this example, the variable `t` will have the
    // type corresponding to its clause.
    whatAmI := func(i interface{}) {
        switch t := i.(type) {
        case bool:
            fmt.Println("I'm a bool")
        case int:
            fmt.Println("I'm an int")
        default:
            fmt.Printf("Don't know type %T\n", t)
        }
    }
    whatAmI(true)
    whatAmI(1)
    whatAmI("hey")
}
```

In golang, the designers try to make everything simple, so you can see some strange syntax compared with other languages. In these three control structures, the common point is that an optional assignment statement can be in the three expressions just to simplify our program.

**Output:**

```
$ go run switch.go 
Write 2 as two
Yes
It's a weekday
It's after noon
I'm a bool
I'm an int
Don't know type string
```

## 3. Summary

For now, you have a further understanding of golang. Practice makes perfect, so take some examples to  get well acquainted with these three control structures.
