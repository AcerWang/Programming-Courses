# Functions

## 1. Introduction

Functions are code block which realize specific functionality. Functions are central in Go. Functions are first-class citizens in golang, functions have their own types the function type. There are some different kind of presentation with functions, functions with or without return values, function with fixed  or arbitrary number of parameters. With closure and recursion, you can easily achieve functional programming. If you continue to learn subsequent labs, you can write powerful program.

#### Learning Objective

- functions
- multiple return values
- variadic functions
- closures
- recursion

### 2.1 Functions

We'll learn about functions with a few different examples. We use the keyword `func` to declare a function.  The syntax is like this:

```go
// the returns can include variables and types, or just types

func name(param) returns {
	// some code
}

func name(params) (returns) { 
	// some code
}
```

Here's a function that takes two `int`s and returns their sum as an `int`. Go requires explicit returns, i.e. it won't automatically return the value of the last expression. When you have multiple consecutive parameters of the same type, you may omit the type name for the like-typed parameters up to the final parameter that declares the type. Call a function just as you'd expect, with `func(args)`. There are several other features to Go functions. One is multiple return values, which we'll look at next. Write the following code in `functions.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// function with two integer parameters
// return the sum of them.
func plus(a int, b int) int {
	return a+b
}

// another way to realize the same functionality of plus
// here `sum` just like a variable declaration, you can
// use it directly in the function body
func add(a int, b int) (sum int) {
	sum = a+b
	// as we declare the function has a return value
	// the last line of the function must be a return statement
	// you can omit what to return, go compiler is smart enough
	// to automatically return sum which must be appear 
	// as this case in function declaration
	// return sum
    return
}

// function with three integer parameters
// as all parameters are the same type
// just omit all type name but the last one.
func plusPlus(a, b, c int) int {
	return a + b + c
}

func main() {

    // call a function with `func(args)`.
    res := plus(1, 2)
    fmt.Println("1+2 =", res)

	// call add
	res = add(5, 5)
	fmt.Println("5+5 =",res)
	// call plusPlus
    res = plusPlus(1, 2, 3)
    fmt.Println("1+2+3 =", res)
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run functions.go 
1+2 = 3
5+5 = 10
1+2+3 = 6
```

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/Code/functions.go
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "functions.go" in /home/labex/Code!
  timeout: 3
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'func\s+\w+\(.+\)' /home/labex/Code/functions.go
  error: Oops, we find that you didn't define any custom function in "functions.go", use "func func_name(param_list type)" to define a function.
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.2 Multiple return values

Go has built-in support for *multiple return values*. This feature is used often in idiomatic Go, for example to return both result and error values from a function. The `func name(params) (int, int)` , this function signature shows that the function returns 2 `int`s. Here we use the 2 different return values from the call with *multiple assignment*. If you only want a subset of the returned values, use the blank identifier `_`. Write the following code in `multiple-return-values.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// this function returns 2 `int`s.
func vals() (int, int) {
	return 3, 7
}

func main() {

    // receive the 2 different return values from the
    // call with _multiple assignment_.
    a, b := vals()
    fmt.Println(a)
    fmt.Println(b)

    // if you only want a one of the returned values,
    // use the blank identifier `_` to ignore.
    _, c := vals()
    fmt.Println(c)
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run multiple-return-values.go
3
7
7
```

Accepting a variable number of arguments is another nice feature of Go functions, we'll look at this next.

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/Code/multiple-return-values.go
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "multiple-return-values.go" in /home/labex/Code!
  timeout: 3
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'return .*,' /home/labex/Code/for.go
  error: Oops, we find that you didn't "return" multiple values in "multiple-return-values".
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.3 Variadic functions

*Variadic functions* can be called with any number of trailing arguments. For example, `fmt.Println` is a common variadic function. Here's a function that will take an arbitrary number of `int`s as arguments. Variadic functions can be called in the usual way with individual arguments. If you already have multiple args in a slice, apply them to a variadic function using `func(slice...)`. Write the following code in `variadic-func.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// function take an arbitrary number of integers as arguments.
func sum(nums ...int) {

    fmt.Print(nums, " ")
    total := 0
    for _, num := range nums {
        total += num
	}
	fmt.Println(total)
}

func main() {

    // call a variadic functions in the usual way as the individual arguments.
    sum(1, 2)
    sum(1, 2, 3)

    // apply a slice to a variadic function
    // like this `func(slice...)`.
    nums := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
    sum(nums...)
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run variadic-func.go 
[1 2] 3
[1 2 3] 6
[1 2 3 4] 10
```

> Another key aspect of functions in Go is their ability to form closures, which we'll look at next.

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/Code/variadic-func.go
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "variadic-func.go" in /home/labex/Code!
  timeout: 3
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'func.*\(.*\.\.\..*\)' /home/labex/Code/for.go
  error: Oops, we find that you didn't define variadic function like "func name(param ... type)" in "variadic.go".
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.4 Closures

Go supports *anonymous functions*, which can form *closures*. Anonymous functions are useful when you want to define a function inline without having to name it. In this example, the function `intSeq` returns another function, which we define anonymously in the body of `intSeq`. The returned function *closes over* the variable `i` to form a closure. We call `intSeq`, assigning the result (a function) to `nextInt`. This function value captures its own `i` value, which will be updated each time we call `nextInt`. See the effect of the closure by calling `nextInt` a few times. To confirm that the state is unique to that particular function, create and test a new one. Write the following code in `closures.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// the function `intSeq` returns another function,
// which we define anonymously in the body of `intSeq`. 
// the returned function can access variable `i` outside `intSeq`
func intSeq() func() int {
    i := 0
    return func() int {
        i++
        return i
    }
}

func main() {

    // call `intSeq`, assigning the result (a function) to `nextInt`.
    // this new function captures its
    // own `i` value, which will be updated each time
    // we call `nextInt`.
    // the lifetime of `i` is still keep alive 
    // after calling `intSeq` 
    nextInt := intSeq()
    
    // each time, we call nextInt, it increase variable `i`
    fmt.Println(nextInt())
    fmt.Println(nextInt())
    fmt.Println(nextInt())
    
    // the state of each call to `intSeq` is unique
    // create and test a new one.
    newInts := intSeq()
    fmt.Println(newInts())
}
```
**Output:**

```
$ go run closures.go
1
2
3
1
```

In this example, the lifetime of variable `i` is expanded as the inner function hold reference to it, not determined by its scope. To make use of the advantages of closure, we offen combine it with maps and slices to provide wrapper functionalities to their items. Closures are powerful techniques. The last feature of functions we'll look at for now is recursion. 

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/Code/closures.go
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "closures.go" in /home/labex/Code!
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.5 Recursion

Go supports *recursive functions*. Here's a classic factorial example. This `fact` function calls itself until it reaches the base case of `fact(0)`. Write the following code in `recursion.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// calculate factorial of an integer.
func fact(n int) int {
    if n == 1 {
        return 1
    }
    // call its self until parameter is zero
    return n * fact(n-1)
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(fact(7))
}
```
**Output:**

```
$ go run recursion.go 
5040
```

Function calling  is operation of stack push and function returning is operation of stack pop. For the whole procedure of recursion, it's like this:


![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/Y/P/D/ESEA6YoKlGX4.png)

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/Code/recursion.go
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "recursion.go" in /home/labex/Code!
  timeout: 3
```

## 3. Summary

This lab is very important, and some conception are hard to comprehend, so you need to read more and  write more, remember that pratice makes perfect. Functions are usually combinated with interface (we can achieve passing any types of parameters to a function) and struct (this  is more like the OOP paradigm) which will be learnd later.
