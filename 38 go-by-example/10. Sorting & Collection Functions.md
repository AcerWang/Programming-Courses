# Sorting & Collection Functions

## 1. Introduction

Go implements sort for some built-in types, you can use it by importing the `sort` package. You can customize your own sorting rule by implementing sort interface. Define some functions with a function as parameter, applying to iterable objects, just like generic methods in some other languages.

- sorting by functions
- collection functions

### 2.1 Sorting

Go's `sort` package implements sorting for builtins and user-defined types. We'll look at sorting for builtins first. Sort methods are specific to the built-in type, here's an example for strings. Note that sorting is in-place, so it changes the given slice and doesn't return a new one.

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "sort"

func main() {

	// sort for string, relating to the alphabet
	strs := []string{"c", "a", "b"}
    sort.Strings(strs)
    fmt.Println("Strings:", strs)
    
    // sort for int
    ints := []int{7, 2, 4}
    sort.Ints(ints)
    fmt.Println("Ints:   ", ints)
    
    // Check if a slice is already in sorted order.
    s := sort.IntsAreSorted(ints)
    fmt.Println("Sorted: ", s)
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run sorting.go
Strings: [a b c]
Ints:    [2 4 7]
Sorted:  true
```

    grep -i 'sort' /home/labex/Code/sorting.go
    error: Oops, we find that you didn't use package "sort" in "sorting.go".
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.2 Sorting by Functions

Sometimes we'll want to sort a collection by something other than its natural order. For example, suppose we wanted to sort strings by their length instead of alphabetically. Here's an example of custom sorts in Go. In order to sort by a custom function in Go, we need a corresponding type. Here we've created a `byLength` type that is just an alias for the builtin `[]string` type.

```go
package main

import "sort"
import "fmt"

type byLength []string

// We implement sort.Interface - Len, Less, and Swap on our type
// so we can use the sort package's generic Sort function.
// Len and Swap will usually be similar across types 
// and Less will hold the actual custom sorting logic.
// In our case we want to sort in order of increasing string length,
// so we use len(s[i]) and len(s[j]) here.
// if Less returens true, then Swap
func (s byLength) Len() int {
    return len(s)
}
func (s byLength) Swap(i, j int) {
    s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
}
func (s byLength) Less(i, j int) bool {
    return len(s[i]) < len(s[j])
}

func main() {

	// With all of this in place,
    // we can now implement our custom sort 
    // by casting the original fruits slice to byLength,
    // and then use sort.Sort on that typed slice.
    fruits := []string{"peach", "banana", "kiwi"}
    sort.Sort(byLength(fruits))
    fmt.Println(fruits)
}
```

Running our program shows a list sorted by string length, as desired.

**Output:**

```
$ go run sort-by-func.go 
[kiwi peach banana]
```

By following this same pattern of creating a custom type, implementing the three `Interface` methods on that type, and then calling sort.Sort on a collection of that custom type, we can sort Go slices by arbitrary functions.

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/Code/sort-by-func.go
    error: Sorry, you didn't create file "sort-by-func.go" in /home/labex/Code!
  timeout: 3
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'sort' /home/labex/Code/sorting.go
    error: Oops, we find that you didn't use package "sort" in "sort-by-func.go".
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.3 Collection Functions

We often need our programs to perform operations on collections of data, like selecting all items that satisfy a given predicate or mapping all items to a new collection with a custom function. In some languages it's idiomatic to use generic data structures and algorithms. Go does not support generics, in Go it's common to provide collection functions if and when they are specifically needed for your program and data types. Here are some example collection functions for slices of `strings`. You can use these examples to build your own functions. Note that in some cases it may be clearest to just inline the collection-manipulating code directly, instead of creating and calling a helper function.

```go
package main

import "strings"
import "fmt"

// Index returns the first index of the target string t,
// or -1 if no match is found.
func Index(vs []string, t string) int {
    for i, v := range vs {
        if v == t {
            return i
        }
    }
    return -1
}

// Include returns true if the target string t is in the slice.
func Include(vs []string, t string) bool {
    return Index(vs, t) >= 0
}

// Any returns true if one of the strings in the slice satisfies the predicate f.
func Any(vs []string, f func(string) bool) bool {
    for _, v := range vs {
        if f(v) {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}

// All returns true if all of the strings in the slice satisfy the predicate f.
func All(vs []string, f func(string) bool) bool {
    for _, v := range vs {
        if !f(v) {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}

// Filter returns a new slice containing all strings
// in the slice that satisfy the predicate f.
func Filter(vs []string, f func(string) bool) []string {
    vsf := make([]string, 0)
    for _, v := range vs {
        if f(v) {
            vsf = append(vsf, v)
        }
    }
    return vsf
}

// Map returns a new slice containing the results of
// applying the function f to each string in the original slice.
func Map(vs []string, f func(string) string) []string {
    vsm := make([]string, len(vs))
    for i, v := range vs {
        vsm[i] = f(v)
    }
    return vsm
}

func main() {

	// We try out our various collection functions.
	var strs = []string{"peach", "apple", "pear", "plum"}
	
	// The index of 'pear' in strs
	fmt.Println(Index(strs, "pear"))
	
	// Whether 'grape' is in strs
	fmt.Println(Include(strs, "grape"))
	
	// Whether items in strs starts with 'p'
	fmt.Println(Any(strs, func(v string) bool {
        return strings.HasPrefix(v, "p")
    }))
    
    // Whether all items in strs starts with 'p'
    fmt.Println(All(strs, func(v string) bool {
        return strings.HasPrefix(v, "p")
    }))
    
    // Get all items in strs, which contain 'e' 
    fmt.Println(Filter(strs, func(v string) bool {
        return strings.Contains(v, "e")
    }))
    
    // Convert items in strs into uppercase
    fmt.Println(Map(strs, strings.ToUpper))
    
}
```

The above examples all used anonymous functions, but you can also use named functions of the correct type.

**Output:**

```
$ go run collections.go 
2
false
true
false
[peach apple pear]
[PEACH APPLE PEAR PLUM]
```

## 3. Summary

In this part, we showed you how to implement methods for your custom data type using the standard built-in interface to satisfy specific rule. As there is no generic type in Go, we simulated an implementation of generic methods. Using these examples, we want you to understand the underlying principle.
