# Processes & Signals

## 1. Introduction

If your program of Go need to execute system call, it will create a new system process or replace the current one with a new one. Unix signals are used to notify our program what happens. Check the learning materials for more information.

#### Learning Objective

- spawning processes
- exec'ing processes
- signals

### 2.1 Spawning Processes

Sometimes our Go programs need to spawn other, non-Go processes. For example, the syntax highlighting on this site is [implemented](https://github.com/mmcgrana/gobyexample/blob/master/tools/generate.go) by spawning a [`pygmentize`](http://pygments.org/) process from a Go program. Let's look at a few examples of spawning processes from Go. We'll start with a simple command that takes no arguments or input and just prints something to stdout. Write the following code in `spawn-process.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "io/ioutil"
import "os/exec"

func main() {

	// The exec.Command creates an object to represent this external process.
	dateCmd := exec.Command("date")
	
	//.Output handles the common case of running a command,
    // waiting for it to finish, and collecting its output.
    // If there were no errors, dateOut will hold bytes with the date info.
	dateOut, err := dateCmd.Output()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Println("> date")
    fmt.Println(string(dateOut))
    
    // We pipe data to the external process
    // on its stdin and collect the results from its stdout.
    grepCmd := exec.Command("grep", "hello")
    
    // Here we explicitly grab input/output pipes,
    // start the process, write some input to it,
    // read the resulting output, and finally wait for the process to exit.
    grepIn, _ := grepCmd.StdinPipe()
    grepOut, _ := grepCmd.StdoutPipe()
    grepCmd.Start()
    grepIn.Write([]byte("hello grep\ngoodbye grep"))
    grepIn.Close()
    grepBytes, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(grepOut)
    grepCmd.Wait()
    
    // We ommited error checks in the above example,
    // but you could use the usual if err != nil pattern for all of them.
    // We also only collect the StdoutPipe results,
    // but you could collect the StderrPipe in exactly the same way.
    fmt.Println("> grep hello")
    fmt.Println(string(grepBytes))
    
    // Note that when spawning commands
    // we need to provide an explicitly delineated command and argument array,
    // vs. being able to just pass in one command-line string.
    // If you want to spawn a full command with a string,
    // you can use bashâ€™s -c option:
    lsCmd := exec.Command("bash", "-c", "ls -a -l -h")
    lsOut, err := lsCmd.Output()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Println("> ls -a -l -h")
    fmt.Println(string(lsOut))
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run spawn-process.go 
> date
Fri Mar  2 17:23:56 CST 2018

> grep hello
hello grep

> ls -a -l -h
total 44K

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/Code/spawn-process.go
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "spawn-process.go" in /home/labex/Code!
  timeout: 3
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'exec' /home/labex/Code/spawn-process.go
  error: Oops, we find that you didn't use package "exec" in "spawn-process.go".
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.2 Exec'ing Processes

 Sometimes we just want to completely replace the current Go process with another one. To do this, we'll use Go's implementation of the classic `exec` function. For our example we'll exec `ls`. Write the following code in `exec-process.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "syscall"
import "os"
import "os/exec"

func main() {
	
	// Go requires an absolute path to the binary we want to execute,
    // so we'll use exec.LookPath to find it.
	binary, lookErr := exec.LookPath("ls")
    if lookErr != nil {
        panic(lookErr)
    }
    
    // Exec requires arguments in slice form (as apposed to one big string). We'll give ls a few common arguments. Note that the first argument should be the program name.
    args := []string{"ls", "-a", "-l", "-h"}
    
    // Exec also needs a set of environment variables.
    env := os.Environ()
    
    // If this call is successful, the execution of our process will end here
    // and be replaced by the /bin/ls -a -l -h process.
    // If there is an error we'll get a return value.
    execErr := syscall.Exec(binary, args, env)
    if execErr != nil {
        panic(execErr)
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run exec-process.go
total 44K
drwxrwxr-x  2 labex labex 4.0K Mar 2 17:25 .
drwxr-xr-x 14 labex labex 4.0K Mar 2 17:26 ..
...
```

Note that Go does not offer a classic Unix `fork` function. Usually this isn't an issue though, since starting goroutines, spawning processes, and exec'ing processes covers most use cases for `fork`.

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/Code/exec-process.go
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "exec-process.go" in /home/labex/Code!
  timeout: 3
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'exec' /home/labex/Code/exec-process.go
  error: Oops, we find that you didn't use package "exec" in "exec-process.go".
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.3 Signals

Sometimes we'd like our Go programs to intelligently handle Unix signals. For example, we might want a server to gracefully shutdown when it receives a `SIGTERM`, or a command-line tool to stop processing input if it receives a `SIGINT`. Here's how to handle signals in Go with channels. Write the following code in `signals.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "os"
import "os/signal"
import "syscall"

func main() {
	
	// Go signal notification works by sending os.Signal values on a channel.
    // We'll create a channel to receive these notifications, 
    // we'll also make one to notify us when the program can exit.
	sigs := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
    done := make(chan bool, 1)
    
    // signal.Notify registers the given channel to receive
    // notifications of the specified signals.
    signal.Notify(sigs, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)
    
    // This goroutine executes a blocking receive for signals.
    // When it gets one it'll print it out and then notify the program that it can finish.
    go func() {
        sig := <-sigs
        fmt.Println()
        fmt.Println(sig)
        done <- true
    }()
    
    // The program will wait here until it gets the expected signal
    // as indicated by the goroutine above sending a value on done and then exit.
    fmt.Println("awaiting signal")
    <-done
    fmt.Println("exiting")
}
```

When we run this program it will block waiting for a signal. By typing `ctrl-C` (which the terminal shows as `^C`) we can send a `SIGINT` signal, causing the program to print `interrupt` and then exit.

**Output:**

```
$ go run signals.go
awaiting signal
^C
interrupt
exiting
```

    ls /home/labex/Code/signals.go
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "signals.go" in /home/labex/Code!
  timeout: 3
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'signal' /home/labex/Code/signals.go
  error: Oops, we find that you didn't use package "signals" in "signals.go".
  timeout: 3
```

## 3. Summary

This part is related to the operation system, in windows, the programms can not work. Here we use some linux commands, if you  are not familar with them, resort to the courses of linux on our website.
So far, our Go by Example course has ended. We hope you have had a good experience. Thanks for learning!
