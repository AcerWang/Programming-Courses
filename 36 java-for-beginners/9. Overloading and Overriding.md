# Overloading & Overriding

## 1. Introduction

In this lab, you will learn the method overloading and overriding. The overriding and overloading are two concepts used in java programming languages. Both the concepts allow the programmer to provide different implementations for methods under the same name. Overloading happens at compile-time while Overriding happens at runtime, the static method can be overloaded but cannot be overridden.Overloading is static bond while overriding is dynamic bond.

#### Learning Objective

- Overloading 
- Overriding

### 2.1 Overloading

In previous part, we have already used overloading in class Person as it had three constructors, that's a simple exmaple. Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, by means of this, we can handle different situations and won't be confused. Typically, there are three ways to overloading:

- Different numbers of parameters
- Different order of parameters
- Different types of parameters

**Example**

```java
public class overloadingTest{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        overloadingTest test = new overloadingTest();
        System.out.println("add(10,20)= " + test.add(10,20));
        System.out.println("add(10,20,30)= " + test.add(10,20,30));
        System.out.println("add(5.5, 10.5)= " + test.add(5.5f, 10.5f));
        
        test.printInfo(1 , "an error!");
        test.printInfo("another error!" , 2);
    }
    // this method has two int params, return an integer
    int add(int a, int b){
        return a+b;
    }
    // this method has three int params, return an integer
    int add(int a, int b, int c){
        return a+b+c;
    }
    // this method has two float params, return an float number
    float add(float a, float b){
        return a+b;
    }
    // this method has one string param and one int param, return nothing
    void printInfo(String str, int code){
    	System.out.println("Code: " + code + "\nMessage: " + str);
    }
    // this method has one string param and one int param, return nothing
    void printInfo(int code, String str){
    	System.out.println("Code: " + code + "\nMessage: " + str);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
add(10,20)= 30
add(10,20,30)= 60
add(5.5, 10.5)= 16.0
Code: 1
Message: an error!
Code: 2
Message: another error!
```

### 2.2 Overriding

If a class inherits a method from its superclass, then there is a chance to override the method provided that it is not marked final or private. By overriding, we can define a behavior that's specific to the subclass, which means a subclass can implement a parent class method based on its requirement. In OOP, overriding means to override the functionality of an existing method. The return type should be the same or a subtype of the return type declared in the original overridden method in the superclass. The access level cannot be more restrictive than the overridden method's access level. For example: If the superclass method is declared public then the overridding method in the sub lass cannot be either private or protected. We also use the case of Animal (a simple edition),

**Example**

```java
class Animal{
	public void grow(){
		System.out.println("I'm animal, I grow up.");
	}
    public void sleep(){
		System.out.println("I'm animal, I am sleeping.");
	}
}
class Dog extends Animal{
	// overriding method
	public void grow(){
		System.out.println("I'm dog, I grow up.");
	}
}
class Bird extends Animal{
	// keep superclass grow(), add own statements
	// overriding method
	public void grow(){
		super.grow();
		System.out.println("I'm bird, I grow up.");
	}
    // overriding method
    public void sleep(){
		System.out.println("I'm bird, I am sleeping...");
	}
    // Bird own method
    public void sing(){
		System.out.println("I'm bird, I am singing a song...");
	}
}
public class overridingTest{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Dog dog = new Dog();
		dog.grow();
		Bird bird = new Bird();
		bird.grow();
	}
}
```

**Output:**

```
I'm dog, I grow up.
I'm animal, I grow up.
I'm bird, I grow up.
```

## 3. Exercise

Try to run this code, and see the result, can you find some special ones.

```java
public class overridingTest{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		// directly use Dog as a receiver
         Dog dog = new Dog();
		dog.grow();
		dog.sleep();
        // use Animal as a receiver, auto cast the type
		Animal bird = new Bird();
		bird.grow();
         bird.sleep();
	}
}
```

## 4. Summary

To organize a big project needs good thought of architecturing, so you should know the essential of concepts in this lab. Overriding and overloading providing us more flexibility to make use of methods.
