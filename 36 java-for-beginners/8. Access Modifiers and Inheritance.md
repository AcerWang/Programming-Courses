# Access Modifiers & Inheritance

## 1. Introduction

In this lab, you will learn aceess modifiers and inheritance. Different modifiers, the access level is different. Inheritance in Java is like biological inheritance, the children can keep parent's features and behave differently in some way.

#### Learning Objective

- Access Modifiers
- Inheritance

## 2. Content

### 2.1 Access Modifiers

For now, we have already write some code. In last lab, we write a class, there are some modifiers like public, private, so what's these words meanning?

Java provides a number of access modifiers to set access levels for classes, variables, methods, and constructors. The four access levels are:

- **default:** Visible to the package, the default. No modifiers are needed.
- **private:** Visible to the class only.
- **public:** Visible to the world, you can access anywhere.
- **protected:** Visible to the package and all subclasses.

Java provides a number of non-access modifiers to achieve many other functionalities.

- **static:** This modifier used to create variables or methods that will exist independently of any instances created for the class. Only one copy of the static variable exists regardless of the number of instances of the class.
- **final:** A final variable can be explicitly initialized only once. A final method cannot be overridden by any subclasses. A class being declared as final is to prevent the class from being subclassed.
- **abstract:** An abstract class can never be instantiated. An abstract method is a method declared without any implementation.
- **synchronized/volatile:** The synchronized and volatile modifiers, which are used for threads.

**Example**

```java
public class modifierTest {
    // static variables are initialized when class is loaded.
    public static int i = 10;
    public static final int NUM = 5;
    // non-static variables are initialized when object is created.
    public int j = 1;
    
    /* 
     * static code block here, this will execute when the class is loaded
     * create new object will not execute the block again, only run for once.
    */
    static{
    	System.out.println("this is a class static block.");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args)
    { 
        System.out.println("this is in main method"); 
        
        // you can access i and change it
        modifierTest.i = 20;  //the same with obj.i = 20
        System.out.println("Class variable i = " + modifierTest.i);
        // you can access NUM, but cann't change it
        // HelloWorld.NUM = 10;     this will cause an error, NUM is final, it's unmutable
        System.out.println("Class variable NUM = " + modifierTest.NUM);
        
        // create new object
        modifierTest obj = new modifierTest();
        // we can use both class and object to access static methods and static properties
        obj.staticMethod();  // the same with modifierTest.staticMethod()
        // you cann't access j like this modifierTest.j
        System.out.println("Object variable j = " + obj.j);
    }
    // the constructor, only new object being created will call this.
    public modifierTest(){
    	System.out.println("this is in object's constructor.");
    }
    public static void staticMethod(){
    	System.out.println("this is a static method");
    }
}
```
**Output:**

```
this is a class static block.
this is in main method
Class variable i = 20
Class variable NUM = 5
this is in object's constructor.
this is a static method
Object variable j = 1
```

### 2.2 Inheritance

In many cases, we write a class, then we write a new class just needing to modify a little of previous class and they have some relation in logical. We can use inheritance, we use the keyword extends to implement inheritance. The subclasses have all the properties and methods in the super class by inheritance, and subclasses can also have their own special ones. In subclasses, we can access the ones that are declared as public,protected, but for the private, we cann't access directly. See an example, the inheritance structure is showed as the picture, you can implement multilevel inheritance(horizontal) or hierarchical inheritance(vertical).

**Example**

```java
class Animal{
	// what kind of animal i am.
	private String species;
	private int age = 8;
	
	public Animal(){
		System.out.println("Animal's constructor");
	}
	public void grow(){
		// In this class, we can access the private properties directly.
		System.out.println("I'm "+ this.age + " years old, " +"I grow up.");
	}
}
class Dog extends Animal{
	private String color;
	// In this class, we cann't access superclass private attributors, but grow() is ok. 
	public Dog(){
		System.out.println("Dog's constructor");
	}
	public void run(){
		this.grow();
		System.out.println("I'm dog, I can run.");
	}
}
class Bird extends Animal{
	private double weight;

	public Bird(){
		// if explicitly invoke superclass constructor, it must be at the first line here.
		// super();
		System.out.println("Bird's constructor");
	}
	public void fly(){
		this.grow();
	    System.out.println("I'm bird, I can fly.");
	}
}
public class inheritanceTest{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Dog dog = new Dog();
		dog.run();

		Bird bird = new Bird();
		bird.fly();
	}
}
```

**Output:**    

```
Animal's constructor
Dog's constructor
I'm 8 years old, I grow up.
I'm dog, I can run.
Animal's constructor
Bird's constructor
I'm 8 years old, I grow up.
I'm bird, I can fly.
```

When you see this output, you may get confused. Don't worry, we'll explain why. When we create an object of a subclass using new method, it by default firstly invokes the default constructor of super class from the inheritance tree structure top-down and lastly executes its own constructor. The superclass constructor can be called explicitly using the super keyword, but it should be first statement in a constructor. The super keyword refers to the superclass, immediately above of the calling class in the hierarchy.

## 3. Exercise

In the design pattern, there's one called singleton. It's very special, only one instance of a class exists , you cann't create more. Think about how to use access modifier to achieve this. You can use the upper case, such as,

```java
Animal animal_1 = Animal.getSingleton();
Animal animal_2 = Animal.getSingleton();
animal_1 == animal_2;  // true
```

> `static ` and `private` modifier, and the constructor.

## 4. Summary

With access modifiers, we can write safe code, hide details, achieve aceess control, other uses needn't to know how we implement details of functions, we provide an interface to other invokers. For access modifiers, you can read Java source code libraries to understand what's the differences. The inheritance, keep in mind the hierarchical structures, the relationship of classes.
