# Java Programming Language Introduction 
The programming language you will be learning is Java, which is relatively new (Sun released the first version in May, 1995). Java is an example of a high-level language; other high-level languages you might have heard of are Python, C or C++, and Perl.

## 1. Experiment Introduction

In this section, we introduce what high-level programming language is, what advantages it has and how Java works, then we teach you how to write the first Java program and run it.
## 2. Content
- What is a programming language? 
- What is a program?
- The first Java program 
### 2.1  What is a programming language? 
As you might infer from the name “high-level language”, there are also low-level languages, sometimes called machine language or assembly language. Loosely-speaking, computers can only run programs written in low-level languages. Thus, programs written in a high-level language have to be translated before they can run. This translation takes time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages.

The advantages are enormous. First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language: the program takes less time to write, it’s shorter and easier to read, and it’s more likely to be correct. Second, high-level languages are portable, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level programs can only run on one kind of computer, and have to be rewritten to run on another.

Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level languages. Low-level languages are only used for a few special applications.

There are two ways to translate a program: interpreting and compiling. An interpreter is a program that reads a high-level program and does what it says. In effect, it translates the program line-by-line, alternately reading lines and carrying out commands. A compiler is a program that reads a high-level program and translates it all at once, before running any of the commands. Often you compile the program as a separate step, and then run the compiled code later. In this case, the high-level program is called the source code, and the translated program is called the object code or the executable.

Java is both compiled and interpreted. Instead of translating programs into machine language, the Java compiler generates byte code. Byte code is easy (and fast) to interpret, like machine language, but it is also portable, like a high-level language. Thus, it is possible to compile a program on one machine, transfer the byte code to another machine, and then interpret the byte code on the other machine. This ability is an advantage of Java over many other high-level languages.

Although this process may seem complicated, in most program development environments these steps are automated for you. Usually you will only have to write a program and press a button or type a single command to compile and run it. On the other hand, it is useful to know what steps are happening in the background, so if something goes wrong you can figure out what it is.

### 2.2  What is a program? 
A program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation. The computation might be something mathematical, like solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, like searching and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a program.

The instructions, which we will call statements, look different in different programming languages, but there are a few basic operations most languages perform:

 **input:** Get data from the keyboard, or a file, or some other device.<br>
 **output:** Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.<br>
 **math:** Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.<br>
 **testing:** Check for certain conditions and run the appropriate sequence of statements.<br>
 **repetition:** Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.

That’s pretty much all there is to it. Every program you’ve ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of statements that perform these operations. Thus, one way to describe programming is the process of breaking a large, complex task up into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with one of these basic operations.


### 2.3  The first program 

Traditionally the first program people write in a new language is called “hello world” because all it does is display the words “Hello, World.” In Java, this program looks like:

**Example**

    public class Hello {
    	// main: generate some simple output
    	public static void main(String[] args) {
                 System.out.println("Hello, world.");
          }
    }
**Output:**
    Hello,world.
This program includes features that are hard to explain to beginners, but it provides a preview of topics we will see in detail later. Java programs are made up of class definitions, which have the form:

    class CLASSNAME {
    	public static void main (String[] args) {
             // STATEMENTS
      	}
    }  
Here CLASSNAME indicates a name chosen by the programmer. The class name in the example is Hello.

main is a method, which is a named collection of statements. The name main is special; it marks the place in the program where execution begins. When the program runs, it starts at the first statement in main and ends when it finishes the last statement.

main can have any number of statements, but the example has one. It is a print statement, meaning that it displays a message on the screen. Confusingly, “print” can mean “display something on the screen,” or “send something to the printer.” In this book I won’t say much about sending things to the printer; we’ll do all our printing on the screen. The print statement ends with a semi-colon (;).

System.out.println() is a method provided by one of Java’s libraries. A library is a collection of class and method definitions.

Java uses squiggly-braces ({ and }) to group things together. The outermost squiggly-braces contain the class definition, and the inner braces contain the definition of main.

Line begins with //. That means it’s a comment, which is a bit of English text that you can put in a program, usually to explain what it does. When the compiler sees //, it ignores everything from there until the end of the line.

Here, we introduce two ways of running the first Java program: using command lines and using an IDE.

**Using command lines to compile and run**

First, open the gedit ( or other text editor ) and type these code:

Second, save these code to a file called 'Hello.java' on the Desktop. Note that if the saved file name is not the same with the class name in it, you'll get compile errors.

Third, open the Xfce Terminal and type these command lines one by one as the follows, then you'll get a 'Hello.class' file on the Desktop and see the output 'Hello,world.' in the Xfce Terminal. 'javac' command is used to compile a source code file; 'java' command is used to run the compiled object.

**Using an IDE**

Here, we recommend Eclipse. In this part, we'll tell you how to establish a Java project and run it.

Open Eclipse, choose File->New->Project.

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/U/G/L/71UBjZrC8J1E.png)

Choose Java Project, and click Next

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/D/B/U/0nY1lJ73A8BK.png)

The project name is test. Click Finish.

When finishing project, right click project test, and choose New->Class to create a new class.

Here, Package name is null ( for simple case, we just don't need package ). Name is Hello and click Finish.

Then, you can see project structure as follow. Type code in the edit area and click Save. Click Run to build and run this project, and you'll see the output below.

```checker
- name: check if file exist
- script: |
    ls /home/labex/Desktop/Hello.java
  error: Hello.java not found in /home/labex/Desktop.
  timeout: 3
```
## 3. Summary

In this experiment, you have learned your first Java program. You should be aware of the process it works. The entrance of a program is always the main function. Also you have learned compiling and running a simple Java program with command lines, as well as using Eclipse to create a Java project and edit class and run the project.
