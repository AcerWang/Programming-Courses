# SELECT Statement

## 1. Introduction

SELECT statement, one of the most commonly used statements in SQL, is used to select data in a table. This lab will learn SELECT and how to apply it to real practices.

#### Learning Objective

- SELECT Basic syntax
- Mathematical symbol conditions
- AND OR IN
- Wildcards
- Sort
- SQL built-in functions and calculations
- Subqueries and joins queries

#### Operation Environment

Lab environment used is Ubuntu Linux 14.04 64. We will also use the following: 

- Mysql 5.5.50
- Xfce terminal

- IN & NOT IN
- Wildcards
- Sort results
- SQL built-in functions and calculations
- Subqueries
- Join 
### 2.1 Preparation

Before we start, download relevant data tables and create a database named `mysql_lab` (3 tables: department, employee, project).

Input command and enter into `/home/labex` directory: 

```shell
cd /home/labex
```

then enter command, and download code:

```shell
wget https://labexfile.oss-us-west-1-internal.aliyuncs.com/courses/7/MySQL-04-01.sql
wget https://labexfile.oss-us-west-1-internal.aliyuncs.com/courses/7/MySQL-04-02.sql
```

When download is complete, enter command, start MySQL service and log in as root:

Start MySQL service
```shell
sudo service mysql start        
```
Log in as root
```shell
mysql -u root                   
```


There are two files `MySQL-04-01.sql` and `MySQL-04-02.sql`, which you just downloaded. The first one is used to create database, and the second one is used to insert data.

（**SQL4 is in /home/labex/. You can use gedit to view the files**）

Load data in the file. You need to enter the command in the MySQL console to build the database: 

```shell
source /home/labex/MySQL-04-01.sql
```

Insert data to database：

```shell
source /home/labex/MySQL-04-02.sql
```

In the database operating statements, the most frequently used, also considered the most important is the SELECT query. In previous labs, we've used `SELECT * FROM table_name;` statements in many places to see everything in a table.
SELECT can be used with keywords of a variety of constraints, which encompass a variety of features. This lab will introduce these use in detail.

```checker
- name: check if directory exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/MySQL-04-01.sql
  error: Sorry, you didn't download file "MySQL-04-01.sql" into /home/labex!
  timeout: 3
- name: check if directory exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/MySQL-04-02.sql
  error: Sorry, you didn't download file "MySQL-04-02.sql" into /home/labex!
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.2 Basic SELECT statement

Basic format of SELECT statement:

```sql
SELECT row name  FROM table name WHERE constraint;
```

If you want to query all contents of the table, then ** query the name of the column ** with an asterisk `*` (we have practiced this trick in lab 2 and 3), which represent all columns in the table will be queried. In most cases, we only need to see the specified column of a table, such as to see the name and age of the employee table:

```sql
SELECT name,age FROM employee;
```

### 2.3 Mathmatical symbol conditions

SELECT statements often have WHERE constraints, used to achieve more accurate query. WHERE constraints can have mathematical notation (`=, <,>,>=, <=`). We just queried the name and age, and now let's make a slight modification:

```sql
SELECT name,age FROM employee WHERE age>25;
```

Filter results with age over 25:

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/F/V/V/stwh5AOALNpI.png)

Or find the name, age, and phone of an employee named Mary:

```sql
SELECT name,age,phone FROM employee WHERE name='Mary';
```

Result：

### 2.4 "AND" & "OR"

We can have more than one constraints after WHERE, and based on the logical relationship of these conditions, we can use **OR** and **AND** to connect:

Filter - age is less than 25, or age is greater than 30
```sql
SELECT name,age FROM employee WHERE age<25 OR age>30;     
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/O/E/B/rrcoMctekzfy.png)


Filter - age is greater than 25, and age is less than 30
```sql
SELECT name,age FROM employee WHERE age>25 AND age<30;    
```


![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/E/Q/T/BfBNKs7F9QoV.png)

If we need to include age 25 and 30, use **age BETWEEN 25 AND 30** ：

### 2.5 IN & NOT IN

Keywords **IN** and **NOT IN** are used to filter results in a certain range. For instance we want to find people in **dpt3** or **dpt4**:

```sql
SELECT name,age,phone,in_dpt FROM employee WHERE in_dpt IN ('dpt3','dpt4');
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/D/A/W/7KqwqWb3OCj2.png)

For **NOT IN**，such as in the following command，we will get people not in **dpt1** nor **dpt3**：

```sql
SELECT name,age,phone,in_dpt FROM employee WHERE in_dpt NOT IN ('dpt1','dpt3');
```

### 2.6 Wildcards

The keyword **LIKE** is used with wildcards in SQL statements, with wildcards representing unknown characters. Wildcards in SQL are `_` and`% `. Which `_` represents an unspecified character,`% `represents **indefinite** unspecified characters.

For example, if you only remember that the first four digits of the phone number are 1101 and the last two digits are forgotten, you can replace them with two `_` wildcards:

```sql
SELECT name,age,phone FROM employee WHERE phone LIKE '1101__';
```

and here we have phone numbers starting with 1101

Another case, such as when you only remember the first letter of the name, and you do not know the length of the name, then use `%` wildcard instead of indefinite characters:

```sql
SELECT name,age,phone FROM employee WHERE name LIKE 'J%';
```

Here we have names starting with **J**:

### 2.7 Sort your results 


In order to make queried results more organized and easy to follow, we might need to sort them by certain rules. **ORDER BY** comes in handy. By default, **ORDER BY** is in **ascending** arrangement, and also by using **ASC** and **DESC**, we can also get results of ascending and descending order.
For example, we sort salary in a descending order, SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT name,age,salary,phone FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

### 2.8 SQL built-in functions and calculations

SQL allows calculation of the data in the table. In this regard, SQL has five built-in functions that do the result of SELECT:

| Function： | COUNT         | SUM    | AVG     | MAX           | MIN           |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------ | ------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| For:       | count numbers | sum up | average | maximum value | minimum value |

> The COUNT function can be used for any data type (because it is only a count), while SUM and AVG functions can only calculate numeric data types. MAX and MIN can be used for numeric, string, or datetime data types.

For example when we want to calculate the maximum and minimum value of salary, we use statement like this:

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) AS max_salary,MIN(salary) FROM employee;
```

You may have noticed a tiny detail. **Use AS keyword can rename value**. E.g. Max value is renamed into max_salary：

### 2.9 Subqueries

The SELECT statements discussed above all involve data in only one table, but sometimes you have to process multiple tables to get the information you need. For example, you want to know a few projects done by the department where the employee named "Tom" is located. Employee information is stored in the employee table, but the project information is stored in the project table.

We can use subqueries to deal with such situations：

```sql
SELECT of_dpt,COUNT(proj_name) AS count_project FROM project
WHERE of_dpt IN
(SELECT in_dpt FROM employee WHERE name='Tom'); 
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/C/Q/P/6b4PbQGexbKx.png)

> Subqueries can also be extended to three, four or more layers.

### 2.10 Join

When dealing with multiple tables, the subquery is only useful when the results are from the same table. However, if you need to display data in two or more tables, you must use the **join** operation.
The basic idea is to connect two or more tables as a new table to operate, as follows:

```sql
SELECT id,name,people_num
FROM employee,department
WHERE employee.in_dpt = department.dpt_name
ORDER BY id;
```

This result is the number of employees in each department, where employee id and name from the employee table, people_num from the department table:

Another connection statement format is to use the JOIN ON syntax. The statement is the same as:

```sql
SELECT id,name,people_num
FROM employee JOIN department
ON employee.in_dpt = department.dpt_name
ORDER BY id;
```

Result is the same.

## 3. Summary

In this lab we learned the basic use of SELECT statement:

- Basic syntax
- Mathmatical symbol conditions
- AND OR IN
- Wildcards
- Sort
- SQL built-in functions and calculations
- Sunqueries and connection queries

## 4. Homework

1. Follow the instructions and complete and process on your own: first create a database and insert data using the code downloaed with git, and then try all those SELECT statements. Make sure take screenshots. 
2. Use the connection query and find out the number of employees and projects in each department. The number of project is named count_project. (Connect three tables and use COUNT built-in functions).
