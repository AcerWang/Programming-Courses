# MySQL Introduction

## 1. Introduction
Whether you are new to MySQL or database, or need a little refresher for an upcoming project, you have come to the right place. This course on MySQL is both for absolute beginners and other experts with experience in database management.

Here, you will learn what Structured Query Language (SQL) and databases are, the basics of database management, how to set up and configure MySQL, and how to get MySQL client to connect to a MySQL Server.

MySQL is an open source, relational database management system (RDBMS). A database is simply a collection of data in a structured format. In a relational database management system such as MySQL, data is organized into tables instead of being stored in a single and large storeroom. MySQL is an open source software, meaning that one can get its source code and modify it in order to meet their needs. The MySQL source code is available under the GNU General Public License. It can be installed and used on various operating systems including Windows, Mac OS, Linux and etc. Although MySQL is very popular in the development of web applications, it is compatible with several other programming languages including Java, C language and etc. MySQL works well even when the datasets involved are large. 

Just a little history background, MySQL was first conceived by a Swedish company known as MySQL AB. Sun Microsystems acquired it in 2008. In 2010, the Oracle corporation bought MySQL, taking over the task of supporting MySQL. 

#### Learning Objective

- Installation of MySQL.
- Basic Management of MySQL.

## 2. Install MySQL
- Install MySQL on Linux/UNIX
- Install MySQL on Windows
### 2.1 Install MySQL on Linux/UNIX

MySQL is mostly installed as part of LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQl, PHP/Python/Perl) stack. It uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for data management. 
The installation of MySQL on Ubuntu is very simple. **We have installed MySQL for you.** In our case, we list all you need to do when you install MySQL server independently on Ubuntu Linux. **You can just omit this chapter and start the next part, it doesn't affect anything.** After the intallation, we will be able to start it from the Linux terminal. 
It follows the steps below:

- Update the package index.
- Install Mysql-Server.
- Execute the included security script.

At this point, your Ubuntu system should be up and running. Launch the terminal from the launcher. Run the following command on the terminal in order to update the package index:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get update
```

Next, run the following command to install the mysql-server:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server
```

When prompted to continue, type "Y" for "yes" then hit the enter key.

A window will appear prompting to enter the password for the root user. Type in the password then hit the enter key.

Next, you will be asked to re-enter the password for confirmation. Re-enter the password then hit the enter key. The installation process will continue. 

Once you see the terminal prompt (`$`), the installation of mysql-server will have completed. Next, run the following command to execute the included security script:

```shell
$ sudo service mysql start
$ mysql_secure_installation
```

You will be prompted to enter the root password for mysql-server. Just type the password you chose during the installation:

![](https://labex.io/upload/J/N/J/mZllg1g6OTZz.jpg)

You will then be taken through a sequence of steps for which you will be expected to type "Y" for "yes" and any other key for "no". If you need additional security measures other than password protection, then you can type "Y", otherwise, type any other key then hit the enter key to proceed. Do this for every step until you are done, when the terminal prompt is returned to you. 

Congratulations, you have just set MySQL on your Ubuntu Linux!

### 2.2 Install MySQL on Windows

The installation of MySQL on Windows operating system is a simple process. You only have to get the MySQL Server binary distributions (MSI files) by downloading them from the developers page of [MyQL website](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/). Ensure that you have administrative rights, then run the MSI files on the Windows machine. You can also right click it then choose "Run as Administrator". 

The installer will take you through a number of steps and everything will be installed. By default, MySQL will be installed under C:\mysql. 

After the installation, you may need to make your MySQL work with PHP. To do this, open the "php.ini" file and find the following lines:

```php
extension=php_MySQL.dll
extension=php_MySQLi.dll
```

Uncomment the above two lines by removing the semicolon (; ) that precedes each line. Save the file then close it. And you are all set!

### 2.3 Test MySQL

Now that you have installed MySQL on your system, it should be up and running. To confirm this, run the following command on the terminal:

```shell
$ sudo service mysql status
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/M/S/B/TDHbmSukfBR7.jpg)

The "Threads" line is an indication that MySQL has been installed and it is running. 

After a successful installation of MySQL, the initialization of the base tables will have been done, and the server will be up and running. 

The mysqladmin binary can help us know the version of MySQL that has been installed on our system. The version can be checked by running the following command:

```shell
$ mysqladmin --version*
```

It should give the following result:

![](https://labex.io/upload/U/J/X/S5RWevaSjEOS.jpg)

As shown in the above output, I have installed MySQL 5.7.20. If you don't get such output, then a problem must have occurred during the installation process. To solve the issue, repeat all the steps above in order to install MySQL on your system. 

## 3. Access MySQL
- Access MySQL by Shell
- Administration
### 3.1 Access MySQL by Shell

Now that MySQL is ready on your system, you will need to access it and perform various tasks including creating databases, creating tables, inserting data and etc. You can access the MySQL shell from the Linux terminal by running the following command:

```shell
$ mysql -uroot -p
```

The "-u" option is for username, which in our case is the root, while the "-p" option is for the password. You will be prompted to enter the password for the user. Note that we are logging as the root user, so provide the root password that you created during the installation of MySQL. You will then be presented with the MySQl prompt from which you can execute your SQL commands:

![](https://labex.io/upload/S/L/B/VykHAeFMqSOx.jpg)


Note that in the above example, we have logged in as the root user. However, you can use the same approach to login as any other user, provided you have an active account in the DBMS. After a successful login, a user is able to perform all activities for which they have been granted privileges. The root user is the top level user will all the privileges that a user can have on the DBMS. To close the connection to the MySQL database, run the "exit" command on MySQL prompt as follows:

![](https://labex.io/upload/L/C/J/YeURMqZLlNAc.jpg)

This will close the connection to the database, and you will see the prompt for your Ubuntu system. 

Whenever you need to clear the terminal, just press "Ctrl + L" keys and everything will be cleared from the terminal. 

### 3.2 Administration

Now, let's discuss the various administration tasks in MySQL.

**(1) Set the Root Password**

The default setting is that MySQL comes with a blank root user password. If you did not create a password during the installation process, the root password is still blank. However, it is possible for you to create this password from the terminal by running the following command:

```shell
$ mysqladmin -u root password "password"
```

**(2) Restart MySQL Server**

Sometimes, you may need to restart your MySQL server. This might be after making some configuration changes and you need them to be applied. To restart your MySQL Server, run the following command on your Ubuntu terminal:

```shell
$ sudo service mysql restart
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/B/Y/D/cf6U55SR57C8.jpg)

Once the command runs, the MySQL Server will be stop and then start. 

**(3) Stop MySQL Server**

For you to stop MySQL, it should be active, that is, up and running. To confirm this, run the following command:

```shell
$ sudo service mysql status
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/M/S/B/TDHbmSukfBR7.jpg)

In my case, MySQL is active.  It is now time for us to stop it from running. The comamnd should be as follows:

```shell
$ sudo service mysql stop
```

To confirm whether MySQL Server has been shut down, you can run the command for showing the status of the server with command `sudo service mysql status`.

![](https://labex.io/upload/A/Q/M/2mcYLI9QufqC.jpg)

As shown above,  the MySQL server has stopped.

**(4) Start MySQL Server**

Now that the MySQL has been stopped, you must start it if you need to use it.  Run the following command:

```shell
$ sudo service mysql start
```

The command will start MySQL Server. You can check its status and you will find that it is up and running.

**(5) Create a MySQL User Account**

In MySQL, all users are kept in the "mysql" database in a table named "user". The creation of new users/accounts is done using the "CREATE USER" command. With the command, one can enable authentication, password-management properties and SSL/TLS to be enabled for the new accounts. The command can also be used to specify whether a newly created account will be locked or unlocked. It takes the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE USER [IF NOT EXISTS]
    user [authentication_option] [, user [auth_option]] ...
    [REQUIRE {NONE | tls_option [[AND] tls_option] ...}]
    [WITH resource_option [resource_option] ...]
    [password_option | lock_option] ...
```

For you to be able to create a new user in the system, you must have the "CREATE USER" privilege, or "INSERT" privilege for MySQL database. In case you try to 
create an account that is already in existence, an error will show up in your screen. Consider the following example:

```sql
CREATE USER 'john'@'localhost'  IDENTIFIED BY 'johnpassword';
```

The command should run successfully once executed:

![](https://labex.io/upload/K/X/I/NZsKDVCqDikL.jpg)

We have created a user named "john". The password for the user is "johnpassword". 

**(6) MySQL Configuration File**

The  /etc/mysql/my.cnf  file has the settings for MySQL. The contents of the file should not be changed unnecessarily. Sometimes, it may be difficult to find the location of the file in your system. To know where this file is located on your system, run the following command on the Ubuntu terminal:

```sql
$ mysql --help | grep "Default options" -A 1
```

In my case, I am given the following options:

- /etc/my.cnf
- /etc/mysql/my.cnf
- ~/.my.cnf

This means that the configuration file can be found in any of the above locations. To get the exact location of the file, you can use the vim editor. In my case, the file is located in the /etc/mysql/my.cnf directory, so I can open it by running the following command on the terminal:

```shell
sudo vim /etc/mysql/my.cnf
```

The file will then be opened in the vimeditor and you can perform any changes that you need. After making any changes to the file, hit the Esc key, type ":wq" and hit the enter key in order to save the changes and exit the editor. You can restart your MySQL Server for the changes to take effect.
