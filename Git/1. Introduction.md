![Git Logo](https://labex.io/upload/D/E/Q/wgeUuG0s6cEZ.png)

##1. Introduction

This lab will teach you the basic concepts about Git (and version control systems in general). It will also include information on how to install Git onto your own computer (relevant to a variety of different operating systems including Windows, Mac OS X and Linux Distributions). By the end of this lab you should be able to have an understanding of what Git is and be able to install it on your own computer.

###Learning Objectives

- Understand the importance of version control and some of the features that it offers.
- Gain an understanding of a brief history of the origin of Git.
- Understand how Git can be beneficial to a development project in terms of performance, security/integrity and flexibility.
- Understand the concept of a software repository.
- Understand the process of installing Git on a variety of relevant operating systems (Windows, Mac OS X and Linux).
- Understand the three types of software repository and the differences between them.
- Have a basic understanding of the Git workflow.
- Understand the concept of a distributed architecture in a version control system and what benefits it holds.

## 2. What is Git?
In the software development industry, working on projects alone is simple. Any changes you make to your code are controlled by you, and you alone. Perhaps your editor even has a fancy version control feature that helps you roll back any changes that you make to your code. You can always copy and paste your files into another folder to back them up, just in case.

This works fine, if you are flying solo. However, in the software development industry, you are not always going to be working alone. For many projects, you will need to work with an entire team of other people. Suddenly, your work environment has just gotten a lot more complex.

At this point, *Version Control Systems* (VCSs) come into play. Version control systems are pieces of software that manage and record changes made to documents, program code and other files. In many cases, a version control system can run at the level of a single program (such as how some word processors have change tracking features). However, in other cases, version control systems can become much more complex and function on a much larger scale.

Git is one such example of large scale version control that is popular among many software developers. It boasts many useful features and is used to track changes to large repositories of data (not just individual files).


### 2.1 The Importance of Version Control
So, why is version control so important? Couldn't you just copy and paste your files into another folder every now and again. While that approach may work in some cases, it is very inefficient compared to using a proper version control system such as Git.

#### Tracking Changes
A VCS such as Git is capable of tracking any changes that occur in files and which user has made them.

For example, if you change a line of code in a simple python script like shown below, a version control system will be able to record that at a specific time that line 12 was changed from `c = a + b` to `c = "Hello World"`. Similarly, a VCS can track lines that are inserted and deleted as well.

```
11 	a, b = 2, 3
12 	c = a + b
13 	print(c)
```

```
11 	a, b = 2, 3
12 	c = "Hello World"
13 	print(c)
```

One benefit of this is that it helps speed up the debugging process if a piece of software suddenly stops working, such as when a program returns "Hello World" (a string), rather than '5' (an integer). Developers can consult the VCS logs and determine that this change was made just before the software stopped working correctly.

#### 2.1.1 Backup and Restoration

Furthermore, a VCS such as Git will also act as a backup system. If there is a sudden software failure that occurs in the latest version (such as by changes in the code above), a VCS can be used to quickly revert the project back to a stable and working state.

This can minimize the impact that mistakes have on budgets and project timelines.

#### 2.1.2 Managing Multiple Collaborators and Code Conflict
Version control is especially important when a project involves multiple programmers and team members. This is for a number of different reasons as listed below. These reasons are particular relevant when working with Git.

- It can be used to keep programmers up to date with the latest working version of the project.
- It provides tools and services for project managers to monitor and control changes to the main code.
- Where possible, it automates the process of handling code merges and even conflicting changes.

#### 2.1.3 Parallel Development
Using an advanced VCS such as Git also allows more advanced project workflows. For example, Git can keep track of multiple different development *branches* in a large scale project. This will be further explored in lab 3, however it essentially means that there could be multiple working versions of the same project being developed simultaneously. This is represented in the diagram below where each node represents a working *version* of the project being developed over time.

#### *Review Questions*

1. Which of the following file changes are not tracked by Git? (D)
  a) Line insertions.
    b) Line modifications.
    c) Line deletions.
    d) None of the above.

    d) It helps manage collaborative coding.

3. Explain the importance of version control in your own words.

4. Name a program that has a built-in version control feature.

### 2.2 Brief History of Git

Git is the most popular version control system and is used by developers all over the world. It was originally developed in 2005 by none other than the famous Linus Torvalds (who is known for the creation of the Linux operating system kernel).

Git is an open source software project and is still actively maintained today.

The meaning of the name 'git' still remains a mystery, and is the subject of much stipulation. The official [git website](https://git-scm.com) claims the name is in reference to 'the stupid content tracker'. According to the readme file in the Git source code (as shown below), this was how Linus described the very first version of Git. It also includes other theories as to what the name 'git' could refer to.

>The name "git" was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very first version. He described the tool as "the stupid content tracker" and the name as (depending on your way):
>>- random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
>>- stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.
>>- "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
>>- "goddamn idiotic truckload of s*it: when it breaks

### 2.3 Git Performance

Due to its small size and lightweight nature, Git runs very fast. With the exception of pushing data to remote servers, all operations are actually performed locally. Furthermore, all of the algorithms behind common Git functions used are optimized for performance in software development projects. This actually grants Git a powerful advantage over its competitors.

Aside from the performance of the software itself, Git is also easy to use. This in return makes projects more efficient.

### 2.4 Git Security and Integrity

The general design of Git is tailored to preserve the integrity of the managed source code. Git does not just store (and secure) the files themselves, it also stores records of different versions, relationships between files and directories, tags and commits. All these repository objects are secured using a hashing algorithm known as SHA1. This secures all change history and ensures that changes are fully traceable.

This also ensures that malicious code changes are recorded as well as the official ones, which can easily be identified and reversed.

### 2.5 Git Flexibility

One of the major selling points of Git is its flexibility. Git natively supports branching, tagging and merging. Whilst these terms may not mean anything yet, they will be investigated later in the course.

As a result of these simple features, Git has the powerful advantage of supporting a wide variety of non-linear project workflows.


## 3. Installing Git

The following section of this lab will include a series of tutorials on how to install Git on various popular operating systems. The first step of this process is to ensure that Git is not already installed on your computer. In order to do this, open a terminal or system command line interface and type `git --version`. 

If Git is installed, your console should display an output similar to what is shown below (note the version number may vary).

![Git Version](https://labex.io/upload/J/A/F/wBH5Pm3Erjy6.jpg)

If you do not have Git installed on your computer, Now please follow the steps in the next (relevant) sections to install it in the virtual environment.

### 3.1 Installing Git on Linux

To install Git on your chosen Linux distribution, the process may vary slightly. Most distributions include Git in their main software repositories. It will need to be installed via your package manager.

But for now, the environment is Linux Ubuntu, thus we'll practice installing Git in Ubuntu system.

#### 3.1.1 Debian-Systems/Ubuntu

All required Git packages should be available via apt-get. Open Xfce terminal on the right and use the following commands.

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install git
```
If you're interested, here's how to install Git on other systems. You can try them out in your local environment once you finish this lab.

### 3.2 Installing Git on Windows

Fortunately, in recent years the installation of Git on Windows machines has become easier with automated installation. It is also possible to select the environment onto which Git will be installed (ie. using Git via *command prompt* or a newly installed shell called *Git Bash*). This decision is entirely up to the user.

1. Download the installer file from the official Git website [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts that appear in the **Git Setup** wizard.
3. Use git from either the *Windows Command Prompt* or *Git Bash* depending on your installation.

### 3.3 Installing Git on Mac OS

There are a large number of ways that Git can be installed on a machine running Mac OS X. This tutorial will only cover two of them. Git is commonly installed with a variety of Mac OS X software by default so be sure to check that it is not already installed on your machine (as described previously).

#### 3.3.1 Using the Git for Mac Installer

This is by far the simplest way to install Git on Mac OS X - via the installer.
1. Download the installer file from the official Git website [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Git on your system.

#### 3.3.2 Installing Git via Homebrew

This method of Git installation is applicable to Mac OS X users who have the *Homebrew* package manager installed on their machines.
1. Open a terminal.
2. Install Git by executing the following command.
3. `brew install git`

#### 3.3.3 Building Git from the Source

It is possible to build Git directly from the source code. This also requires the installation of a number of dependencies.

The process of building Git from the source is beyond the scope of this course.


### 3.4 Configuring Your Git Installation

Once Git has been installed on your system the next step is to verify that Git has actually been installed. As you did before the installation started, execute the following command in the command line of your operating system. It should return a version number as shown below.

```
$ git --version

git version 1.9.1
```

#### 3.4.1 Configuring Your Credentials

Next, use the following commands to configure your Git username and email address (naturally, replacing the name and email shown with your own credentials). This process is important because these details will be associated with any commits that are created from your machine.

```
$ git config --global user.name "Aiden Luo"
$ git config --global user.email "aiden@labex.io"
```

#### 3.4.2 The .gitconfig File

Using the `git config` command (with the `--global` tag), creates a new entry in the global git configuration file.

This file is called `.gitconfig`. On a unix-based environment (such as Linux, Mac OS X or Git Bash on Windows), this file is hidden in the home directory and can be accessed using a simple text editor.

```
$ vim ~/.gitconfig
```

If git is installed in the Windows Command Prompt, the `.gitconfig` file will usually be located in `$HOMEDRIVE$HOMEPATH\.gitconfig`. 

In any case, if you are unsure where your .gitconfig file is located, you can open it via Git using the following command (as an alternate from the methods described above.

```
$ git config --global --edit
```

![Git Config](https://labex.io/upload/T/U/T/W8eZfpGclLRr.jpg)

The `.gitconfig` file contains a number of configuration variables (and values) that can be used to customize your Git environment. Two such variables that we have already seen are `user.email` and `user.name`.

In later labs, we will investigate Git Customization even further.

## 4. The Git Lifecycle

### 4.1 What are Repositories?

Repository. You have come across this term multiple times throughout this lab already, but what does it mean?

There are many definitions for what a repository is. In the context of software development, a repository is basically a centralized file storage location which version control systems use to store multiple versions of files (as well as all the tracking data that it collects about said files).

In Git, there are multiple types of repository. Some are stored locally while others are stored on a server. When considering the Git lifecycle, there are three types of repository to investigate.

In terms of the local repositories, for all intents and purposes, you can almost consider them to be folders that you store all of your project files in.

### 4.2 The Three Types of Repository

When dealing with Git, there are three types of repository to consider:

- *Working Directory*
- *Local Repository*
- *Remote Repository*


#### 4.2.1 Working Directory (Repository)

This type of repository is technically not a repository. However, for simplicity, this set of labs will treat it like it is. The working directory is basically a folder on your local computer that you work in. It is here that you can modify your files, create new ones and delete them. Basically it is just a simple folder that stores all your project materials and is secretly enhanced by Git.

For the next part of this lab, you will need to create a new working directory. Use the following commands to create a new directory and navigate into it (note, you can name it anything you want).

```
$ mkdir repo
$ cd repo
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/S/V/J/u4xqFreZyP8Z.jpg)

Now that you have successfully navigated into this newly created directory, the next step is to create a local repository.

#### 4.2.2 Local Repository

The local repository is not directly viewable on your computer/workstation. Despite this, the local repository is stored locally.

The local repository is an official Git repository. This is where all files from the working directory are submitted. It is the point of local storage for all current and previous versions of your working directory as well as all of the other Git objects (such as tracking data, file/directory relationships etc.).

Since we have already created a new working directory, it is time to initialize a new local repository. This can be done using the `git init` command.

```
$ git init
```

This command has successfully created a new *local repository*.

![Git-Init](https://labex.io/upload/M/B/Q/wS7bABE7OGXH.jpg)

#### 4.2.3 Remote Repository

Finally, a remote repository is a repository that is stored on a server and generally is accessible by multiple people. It is common practice to hold the latest working version of the main project is stored on this repository (ie. the master branch).

A remote repository can be stored on a private server, however, there are also multiple online platforms which can host remote repositories. These include (but are not limited to):

- GitHub
- Bitbucket
- CloudForge
- GitLab
- Codebase

It can also be noted that a lot of these hosting platforms are not necessarily Git-exclusive, meaning that they are compatible with multiple types of version control systems.

A remote repository can be cloned onto your own machine (meaning that it can be copied onto your own computer) using the `git clone` command. This command will not be covered in this lab, however it will be investigated further in the next lab.

### 4.3 The Git Workflow

If you still don't understand the differences between the three types of repository, DON'T PANIC. The Git workflow puts all of them into perspective.

Consider the diagram below. This is representative of the *Git Workflow*. Basically, it shows the three repositories and how data is exchanged between them.

![](https://labex.io/upload/B/Y/K/khJOpN0Rj1Rt.jpg)
<a href="https://fpy.cz/pub/slides/git-workshop/#/step-3"></a>


#### 4.3.1 The Staging Area

You may notice a new term on the diagram (between the working directory and the local repository) - the *staging area*. This is basically the location where files are sent before their changes are committed to the repository. This allows you to update some files in the repository without updating the others, meaning that you do not need to commit all changes in the working repository (only select ones).

#### 4.3.2 Git Workflow Processes

##### Adding

*Adding* is moving a file from the working directory to the staging area. Note that this does not actually move the file on the computer. Instead it is more like the file is 'marked' as being tracked by Git.

To demonstrate this concept, create a simple text file in the repository and fill it with anything you like.
```
$ vim helloworld.txt
```
![Hello-World](https://labex.io/upload/C/A/C/sd4LxaOQOnu8.jpg)

Once this is completed, use the `git status` command to view the status of your working directory.

```
$ git status
```

![Git-Status](https://labex.io/upload/M/K/M/WlspHgQKiyh1.jpg)

As you can see, the file is in the folder, however it is not in the staging area (ie. it is not being tracked). Add your new text file to the staging area with the `git add` command. Then use the command `git status` to view the status of the working directory again.
```
$ git add helloworld.txt
$ git status
```

![Git-Add](https://labex.io/upload/B/V/T/Ww4ZuTIvucWG.jpg)

Now the file has been added to the staging area (ie. Git is now tracking it). This file however, is still in the working directory and not the local repository.

##### Committing

*Committing* is the act of sending a file and its tracking data to the local repository from the staging area. This process is considered permanent (although it is possible to undo commits in extreme cases). Doing so creates a new 'version' in the local repository.

Since our text file has already been added to the staging area, it is now ready to be committed to the local repository. This can be done using `git commit`. The description you want associated with the commit is added after the `-m` tag.

```
$ git commit -m 'My First Commit'
```

![Git-Commit](https://labex.io/upload/I/D/M/cGGtG5uTgbb8.jpg)


Finally, to confirm that our commit was successful, execute `git status` again.

```
$ git status
```

![Git-Commit-Done](https://labex.io/upload/G/W/W/is5i6aBavbj4.jpg)


##### Pushing and Pulling

*Note that these two actions will not be done during this tutorial.*

*Pushing* is the action of sending the contents of the local repository to the remote repository. This copies the latest versions (and all previous versions not stored in the remote repository already) of the local repository to the remote one.

*Pulling* (as expected) is the opposite of pushing. When the user does a 'pull', they copy the contents of the remote repository and merge them into the local repository. This action allows user to update their copy of the remote repository to include changes that other users have made. It is also noteworthy that a pull will generally update the working directory.

##### Checkout

A *checkout* serves multiple functions. It can be used to retrieve files from the local repository and use them to replace their counterparts in the working directory. It can also be used to retrieve old commits (versions) and other development branches.

In this tutorial, we will need to modify the contents of our text file and save it.

```
$ vim helloworld.txt
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/R/G/E/048Zi2MlWAnI.jpg)

Lastly, what we are going to do is replace our modified text file, with the original file that is stored in the repository. This is done using the `git checkout` command.

```
$ git checkout helloworld.txt
```

In order to confirm that our checkout was successful, open the text file in the text editor and confirm that the added text is gone.

```
$ cat helloworld.txt
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/I/B/E/SBD34qx4E5Cv.jpg)

As you can see, the original file from the local repository has replaced the version in the working directory.

Each of these functions (and more) will be investigated further in the next lab.

### 4.4 A Distributed Version Control System

#### 4.4.1 What is a Distributed Version Control System?

One of the main selling points of Git is that it is a distributed version control system. What exactly does this mean?

You recall the concept of the Git workflow, such that files are able to be taken from the remote repository and put into the local repository (the act of *pulling*). Similarly, a *push* will move the contents of the local repository into the remote repository. In a distributed architecture (such as the one used by Git), multiple users on multiple machines can *push* and *pull* from the remote repository. This is how collaborating using Git works.

The diagram below represents a distributed architecture, with multiple local repositories being linked to a single remote repository.

![](https://labex.io/upload/C/B/L/Le9hTTPCZAEh.jpg)


#### 4.4.2 Local Repositories Serve as Backups of the Remote Ones

A major benefit of having a distributed VCS like Git is that each local repository fully mirrors the remote repository. This means that the local repositories are a fully functioning copy of the remote repository (even if they have been updated). Therefore, each local repository cloned from a remote one can serve as a full backup of the remote repository, which can be easily restored in the event of a server failure.

#### 4.4.3 A Much Wider Variety of Potential Project Workflows

Perhaps the most beneficial feature of a distributed VCS (like Git) is that it allows branched development. Said development branches are easy to create and work with using Git. They also can be merged back together relatively easily. As a result, this can result in a huge variety of potential project development workflows. This concept will be further explored in lab 3 of this course.

#### *Review Questions*

1. Describe what a repository is.

2. Which type(s) of repository are stored on a server? (C)
  a) Working directory.
    b) Local repository.
    c) Remote repository.
    d) b and c are both correct.

3. Which action involves sending data from the local repository to a remote repository? (C)
  a) Add.
    b) Commit.
    c) Push.
    d) None of the above.

## 5. Summary

- Describe the difference between a local repository and a working directory.

- Construct a table which describes each action of the Git workflow.

- Do some research and determine two more reasons why version control is useful (reasons that have not been mentioned in this lab already).

- If you haven't done so already, install Git on your personal computer and experiment with it to prepare for the next lab.
