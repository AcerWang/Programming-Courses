# Getting Started With Git

![Git Logo](https://labex.io/upload/D/E/Q/wgeUuG0s6cEZ.png)

##1. Introduction

This lab will continue on from the last where we learned some basic concepts about Git. In this lab we will dive deeper into the use of some commands that have been introduced previously. We will also learn some new Git functions as we begin to learn more advanced Git functionalities.

###Learning Objectives

- Understand the different ways that you can initialize a repository and the commands used (`git init` and `git clone`).
- Understand the concepts and processes behind customizing Git at different configuration levels using the `git config` command.
- Understand the concept of the *staging area* and how to add/remove files from it.
- Understand the process behind a commit and how to do this using a local repository and how to modify files in repository.
- Understand the processes of undoing changes that have been made in a repository (including the use of `git checkout`, `git revert` and `git reset`).
- Understand the features and usages of other git commands including: `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`, `git clean` and ignore rules.

##2. Content

###2.1 Initializing a Repository

There are two main ways that you can start a new local repository on your machine. This next section of the tutorial will teach you how each method works.

####2.1.1 Git Init

The `git init` command is used to initialize a new local repository. It can also be used to make an existing project folder into a Git repository. Generally, most Git commands won't work outside a Git repository. Thus, `git init` will be one of the first commands you will use.

When you run a `git init` command, it will create a hidden subdirectory (called `.git`) in the current working directory. This directory holds all Git configuration files for the project. It is important to note that running `git init` does NOT modify any files in the working directory already (hence how you can convert an existing project folder into a git repository).

####2.1.2 General Usage

As we did in the previous lab, create a new directory in your home directory and initialize a Git repository in it.

```
$ mkdir -p Code/repo
$ cd Code/repo
$ git init
```

This will have successfully created a new Git repository. Run the following command in the practice environment to verify that the `.git` subdirectory was created (the `-a` tag allows the listing of hidden files/folders).

```
$ ls -a
```

![Hiden-Git-Dir](https://labex.io/upload/F/K/B/TeOBfL3edCDH.jpg)

Now move back into your home directory and delete the repository you have just created.

```
$ cd ~/Code
$ rm -rf repo
```

The previous process is useful if you would like to create a repository from an existing directory with contents already in it. However, our directory was empty. A shorthand way to do the above process would be to use the following command.

```
$ git init repo
```

As you can see, giving the `git init` command an argument will cause it to create a subdirectory (with the argument being the name) and initialize the Git repository within it.

Now, delete the repository you have just created so that we can move onto the next stage of the tutorial.

```
$ rm -rf repo
```

#### 2.1.3 Templates

Now we are going to use a template to initialize a new Git repository. Our first step is to create a new template directory and some contents within it (you can fill the files with anything you want). Then move change back into the Code directory (`cd ~/Code`).

Be aware this will add all files from the template directory into the `.git` subdirectory, NOT the main working directory. Templates are used for git configuration items (which we will explore soon).

```
$ mkdir -p ~/Code/RepoTemplate
$ cd ~/Code/RepoTemplate
$ mkdir OtherDir
$ touch repository.txt
$ cd ~/Code
```

Next, initialize the repository again using the following command. As you can see, a RELATIVE path to the template directory needs to be relative to the main working directory of the repository being created. Absolute paths will also work.

```
$ git init repo --template='../RepoTemplate'
$ ls 
$ cd repo/.git
$ ls -a
```

As you can see, all of the contents of the Template directory have been added to the `.git` subdirectory.

![Template-Directory](https://labex.io/upload/O/R/X/Zq2FQDHS58bO.jpg)


#### 2.1.4 Bare Repositories

A bare repository is similar to a remote repository in terms of functionality. These are generally used for repositories that are shared (thus the similarity to remote repositories). Bare repositories do not have a working directory, meaning that the contents cannot be directly modified. Furthermore, you cannot make commits to it either.

The only way to alter data in a bare repository is to use `git push` and `git pull`. Therefore, a bare repository is a storage facility rather than a development environment.

Use the following command to create a bare Git repository.

```
$ git init --bare BareRepository.git
```

You will notice that we have used the .git extension for the BareRepository directory. This is not required, however it is standard convention. If you navigate into the directory and list its contents, you will notice that there is no .git subdirectory. Instead, the contents of the bare repository are the contents of the .git file in a non-bare repository. 

```
$ cd BareRepository.git
$ ls -a
```

![Bare-Repository](https://labex.io/upload/Y/A/X/MDnOWfRt9UKm.jpg)

Therefore, the working directory of the bare repository has been skipped, only the repository files (ie. the content of `.git`) have been included.

### 2.2 Git Clone

The other way of obtaining a Git repository is to use `git clone`. This is different from `git init` because it creates a copy of another repository.

Technically what `git clone` does is call `git init` to create a new repository, then fill it with the contents of another repository - essentially making a copy of a repository.

#### 2.2.1 Usage

Usually `git clone` is used to clone remote repositories, however it can also be used to clone a local repository (which will be shown in this tutorial).

**Cloning from a remote repository:**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/xxx/xxx.git
$ git git@github.com:xxx/xxx.git
```
> As there is no connection to WLAN, so you can't use this command to download remote git repository.
> Note that none of those repositories actually exists, so those commands won't work).

**Cloning from a local repository**

The general syntax of the clone command is as follows, where <repo> is the repository to be cloned and <targetDirectory> is the directory where the repository will be cloned into. <repo> can either be a local path reference or a URL. 

Note if <targetDirectory> is left blank, it will create a directory in the current directory and copy the repository data there.

```
$ git clone <repo> <targetDirectory>
```

In the following example, we will clone our previously created bare repository. This will simulate the experience of cloning a remote repository. First, change back to the home directory where we created the bare repository.

```
$ cd ~/Code
```

Next, run the following command to clone the bare repository into a new repository. Note that the bare repository is empty and your shell will warn you of this.

```
$ git clone BareRepository.git NewRepository
```

If the bare repository held any commits, the latest working version would populate the new repository (which is a regular, non-bare local repository).

Generally, cloning a repository using `git clone` will create a new repository with a remote called 'origin' pointing back to the original repository. We will explore remotes further on, but for now this essentially means that the cloned repository is still linked to the original.

#### 2.2.2 Advanced Options for Clone Configuration

**Shallow Clone**

A shallow clone is basically a clone of a repository, however it only copies the repository to a specified depth. This means that it will only clone the commit history to a specified number of entries. This can be useful for repositories that have a large history of commits and the extra data is not necessary.

```
git clone --depth=3 <repo>
```

In the command above, the repository would be cloned, but the clone would only hold the latest commit and the 2 previous commits.

To obtain a version of the repository that only contains the latest version of the repository, use a depth value of 1.

**Git Clone --mirror and Git Clone --bare.**

You can also use the `--bare` tag to clone a bare repository. This action would clone a copy of a repository (remote or local) that has no working directory. However it would contain the commit history that can be pushed and pulled from.

```
$ git clone --bare <repo>
```

We have not covered remotes yet, but essentially they are the references (or 'links') that a repository has to other repositories. Using the `--bare` tag on a clone will NOT copy the remote references of the original repository, meaning that it will not be linked to repositories that the original was linked to - only the original itself. To clone a repository with all of its remotes entirely, the `--mirror` tag can be used.

```
$ git clone --mirror <repo>
```

**Templates**

By default, a cloned repository (without the `--mirror` tag) will use the default system template for the git integration. However, a template can also be used in the same way that it is used with `git init` (as shown below).

```
$ git clone --template=<templateDirectory> <repo>
```

###2.3 Configuring Your Repository

In the first lab we looked at the `.gitconfig` file. Recall that it was used to customize our Git installation. We used it for configuring our user name and email into our Git installation. Fortunately for us, this was only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to customizing Git.

####2.3.1 Configuration Levels

Recall from the first lab, that the commands we used to set our user name and email included the `--global` tag. This tag was used to set the configuration level for our command.

In Git, there are three levels of configuration. At each level, there is a simple configuration file like `.gitconfig`. The format of each of these files is the same and it can be changed either by modifying the file directly, or using the `git config` command. The latter is easier and will be used in this tutorial.

####2.3.2 System Configuration

Any configuration settings made using the `--system` tag will be applied to the entire machine. That is, they will apply to all repositories of all users on the operating system itself. The configuration file for system configuration is found in a `gitconfig` file in the system root path. In a Unix-based system, it is usually found at `/etc/gitconfig`. If it doesn't exist, you can create it.

Try setting a user name and email for the system in the live environment using the following commands (replacing <name> and <email> with mock data). 

```
$ sudo git config --system user.name <name>
$ sudo git config --system user.email <email>
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/W/O/D/7j7T1n1GLkYi.jpg)

Note if you are getting an error, it is because writing values to this location in a Unix system requires elevated root privileges (hence why sudo is in the command).

####2.3.3 Global Configuration

Configuration at the global level is done using the `--global` tag. This was what we did in lab 1. Any configurations made at a global level apply to all repositories of a specific user of an operating system. Naturally, all the configuration data is stored in the `~/.gitconfig` file as described in lab 1.

Try setting a user name and email at the global level using the following commands. This time, however use a different name and email than you did when setting the system configuration.

```
$ git config --global user.name <name>
$ git config --global user.email <email>
```

####2.3.4 Local Configuration

Any configurations made using the `--local` tag will apply only to the local repository itself, meaning that different repositories are can be individually customized. The configuration data is held in a `config` file within the `.git` directory of the repository (ie. in .git/config). 

Something else to note is that this level of configuration is default by `git config` commands, meaning that if you don't add a configuration level tag, the command will modify the local configuration.

In your home directory, create a new repository named `FabulousCat'.

```
$ cd ~/Code
$ git init FabulousCat
$ cd FabulousCat
```

Now, for this repository, set a user name and email in the local configuration file (be sure to use cat-related puns in your mock data).

```
$ git config --local user.name <name>
$ git config --local user.email <email>
```

####2.3.5 The Hierarchy of Configuration

You might be thinking, 'Wait! What happens if I have different configurations between my global and local levels?'

Well the answer is simple. Configuration works as a hierarchy with system configurations at the bottom and local configurations at the top.

By default, configurations are inherited from the level below it, meaning that if there is a configuration set at a system level, it will be inherited at the global level (and so on). However, if the same configuration is made at a higher level with a different value, it will override the lower level configuration.

To see this, examine the different configuration files using the commands below.

```
$ sudo git config --system --edit
$ git config --global --edit
$ git config --local --edit
```

Based on what is printed to the console, you can see that the variables written at higher levels are overriding the lower ones.

####2.3.6 Usage of the Git Config Command

The `git config` command is easy and simple to use. Recall the format of the configuration files (as shown below).

![](https://labex.io/upload/Q/V/M/8ha59qk0K71V.jpg)

As you can see, there is a common pattern. The value between the square brackets is referred to as the section (`[section]`) and the variable names (eg. name, email) are referred to as subsection(s). Thus, to set a variable, the following skeleton command can be used (provided you fill in the blanks).

```
$ git config --<configuration level> <section>.<subsection> "<value>"
```

Hence, to set a name to 'Kitty' at a local level, the following command would be used.

```
$ git config --local user.name "Kitty"
```

####2.3.7 Aliases

Configurations can also be used to set aliases for use in git. An alias is basically the command line equivalent of a shortcut. All Git aliases are stored in the configuration files. For example, you could assign 'config' to the alias 'cf', then instead of typing 'config' every time you use the command, you only need to type 'cf'.

Try it out!

```
$ git config --local alias.cf config
$ git cf --local user.name "Kitty Kat"
```

Aliases can become infinitely more complex, and you can even create aliases using other aliases!

####2.3.8 Other Configuration Variables

There are a large number of other configuration options available - far too many to be covered in this lab. These can include things like your default text editor and even color. For more details, visit the official Git Config Documentation [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config).

###2.4 Adding Files to the Git Repository

We have already discussed using `git add` to add repository files to the staging area. For the next set of tutorials, create a simple text file and add the image of the fabulous cat below (copy and paste).

```
$ vim KoolKitty.txt
```

```
hello git.
```

####2.4.1 Staging Files (Git Add)

Adding, again, is one of the most fundamental functions of Git. As we discussed in lab 1, using `git add` will add files to the staging area and ready them for a commit.

**Usage**

As we did before, you can add a file to the staging area with the following command.

```
$ git add KoolKitty.txt
```

Also note that this command would also work for directories.

Another way we could do this would be the following.

```
$ git add .
```

Passing `.` to the `git add` command as an argument tells Git to add ALL untracked files in the working directory to the staging area. This is particularly useful when adding multiple files to the staging area in large repositories.

Try it! Use either command to add your text file to the staging area, then use `git status` to see what is in the staging area and what is not.

**Removing Files from the Staging Area**

Sometimes we may add files to the staging area by accident. To remove these files, you can use the following commands.

```
$ git rm --cached KoolKitty.txt
```

As it can be done in the `git add` command, you can also use `.` in the `git rm --cached` command. However you also need to add the recursive flag `-r` in order to be successful.

```
$ git rm -r --cached .
```

Try it! Use either command to remove the text file from the staging area, then use `git status` to ensure that it has been successfully removed.

####2.4.2 Making Commits (Git Commit)

`git commit` is arguably the most important command in Git. As explored in the last lab, committing basically sends all staged file changes to the repository. Note that records of file creations, deletions, moving and name changes are all recorded and sent to the repository as well. This process essentially creates a new *version* in the repository.

**Usage**

There are three key ways to commit changes to the repository. First, ensure that the files are in the staging area (you know how to do this), then run the following command.

```
$ git commit
```

Doing so will open your text editor, which will prompt you to enter a message. A commit always needs to have a message associated with it (and it cannot be plain white space). Failure to include a message will result in the commit being aborted. Enter a message on an uncommented line and close the text editor. The commit will occur automatically.

Now, modify the text file in any way you like. Once your file has been saved, add the file to the stage (you know how), then execute the following command..

```
$ git commit -m 'Second Commit'
```

Using the `-m` flag followed by a string is a way to speed up the commit process. It provides a message (ie. the string), so Git does not need to open a text editor in order to proceed.

Finally, there is one more way to do a commit. Modify the text file yet again, but DO NOT STAGE IT. Execute the following command.

```
$ git commit -a
```

The `-a` flag tells Git to make the commit of the working directory (regardless of what is staged). It will automatically send any changes to files that have previously been staged in the repository history (NOT newly created files). This mode will also open a text editor, however this can be bypassed as well by adding the `-m` flag.

```
$ git commit -am 'Third Commit'
```

### 2.5 Interactive Staging Session

Another interesting feature that can be used to add files to the staging area is an *interactive staging session*. This allows you to choose which portions of a file should be added to the staging area. First, use a text editor to add some text to a line in your `KoolKitty` file.

To start an interactive staging session, use the following command.

```
$ git add -p
```

You will see a preview of the file with all of the changes made. Red lines are from the old version of the file (ie. the latest committed file) and the brown lines below them are the version of the line from the modified file. These changes are referred to as 'chunks'.

The console will prompt you for a command. Press 'y' to stage the chunk. Then commit the staged changes to the repository.

![](https://labex.io/upload/V/K/M/L4rNlTMHQrhi.jpg)

A list of the all possible commands that can be entered during interactive staging is featured in the table below.

| Command | Action                                                       |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| y       | Stage the chunk.                                             |
| n       | Ignore the chunk.                                            |
| s       | Split the chunk into smaller chunks.                         |
| e       | Edit the chunk manually.                                     |
| q       | Quit the interactive staging session.                        |
| g       | Select a chunk to go to.                                     |
| a       | Stage the Chunk and all others in the file.                  |
| d       | Do not stage the chunk or any of the others in the file.     |
| /       | Search for chunk using regex.                                |
| j       | Leave current chunk undecided and move to the next undecided chunk. |
| J       | Leave current chunk undecided and move to the next chunk.    |
| k       | Leave current chunk undecided and move to the previous undecided chunk. |
| K       | Leave current chunk undecided and move to the previous chunk. |
| ?       | Print all of the possible commands to the console.           |

### 2.6 Git Stash

Another useful command in Git is `git stash`. This is particularly useful when working with multiple project branches (which will be explored further in the next lab), because it can be used to move changes between different (and multiple) development branches.

`git stash` can be used to temporarily shelve changes that have been made for later use. This can be useful in situations where you are not quite ready to commit your changes, but want to start working on something else. These changes are removed from the working directory (meaning that files are restored to their states in the latest commit found in the local repository).

For the next part of the tutorial, we will continue using the FabulousCat repository. Commit any unsaved changes and alter the file to give our cat a fabulous hat (by copying and pasting the characters below).

```
       /\  /\
      /  \/  \
    _ \   O / _  
   / \ \   / / \
  /   -    -    \
 (____|____|\___\

```

Now, you might be wanting to start working on something else, but realize that the hat you just put on the cat isn't so fabulous after all. It needs a lot more work (clearly). You need to start working on something else in your repository, but just can't handle the idea that your cat doesn't look cool anymore and you certainly can't commit it. While you work on something else, this change needs to be moved out of the way, but you still need to be able to come back to it.

This is where `git stash` comes to the rescue!

**Usage**

First, use git status.

```
$ git status
```

Clearly, there are uncommitted changes (ie. the hat that you have put on the cat)

Use the following command to stash your changes. Then use git status to view your repository changes again. It is not necessary to include the `save "<message>"` part of the command, however it is good practice to do so. The reason why will become apparent in a minute.

```
$ git stash save "A not so fabulous cat"
$ git status
```

![Git-Stashed](https://labex.io/upload/C/W/W/LzZUb2lqrw0O.jpg)

If you open your KoolKitty.txt file, you will see that all changes have been removed.

If you add the `-p` flag to the stash command, you can also open an interactive session for stashing changes. This process is extremely similar to an *interactive staging session* so it will not be covered in this tutorial. During an *interactive stashing session* the commands are very similar. At the prompt, you can hit `?` to view a full list of possible commands.

```
$ git stash -p
```

**What is Stashed and What is Not**

By default, the stash command will stash ALL changes in the working directory (both tracked and untracked).

However, Git will NOT stash changes in:

- Files that have been ignored (we will explore this later)
- New files that have not previously been staged before

If you wish to stash new and unstaged files, you can add the `-u` flag to the command. If you want to stash these files, as well as ignored files, use the `-a` flag.

```
$ git stash -u
$ git stash -a
```

**Viewing Stashes**

You can view your stashes with the following command. Try it.
```
$ git stash list
```

![Git-Stash-List](https://labex.io/upload/F/P/L/WW1uUv1Kqv4d.jpg)

As you can see, the stash is stored. For all intents and purposes of Git, the stash is identified uniquely as `stash@{0}`. If more stashes are added, this stash will become `stash@{1}` and the newest one will become `stash@{0}`, and so forth for all list items. Thus, the latest stash is always `stash@{0}`.

**Viewing Stash Differences**

You can also see the differences between stashes and the current working directory. You can do this using either of the following commands. Try them both!

```
$ git stash show
$ git stash show -p
```

![Git-Stash-Show](https://labex.io/upload/G/U/R/Rp9IqBxnWHIH.jpg)

Good!  Using the `-p` flag will provide a full view of the differences in a stash.

**Reapplying Stashed Changes**

There are two ways to reapply stashed changes. The first is using `git stash apply <Stash Identifier>`. This command will  add the changes back into the repository, however the stash will still exist in the stash list (hence it could be applied multiple times to multiple branches). 

The second way is using `git stash pop <Stash Identifier>`. This command will add the stashed changes back into the repository and remove it from the stash list. Thus this command can only be used once. Something else to note is that if you use `git stash pop` without a stash identifier, it will automatically add changes from and remove the latest stash (`stash@{0}`).

Try it now. Use both of these commands (with the apply first). In between them, retrieve the local repository copy of the KoolKitty.txt file (HINT: use `git checkout`). Also, view the stash list after each reapply is done.

```
$ git stash apply stash@{0}
$ git stash list
$ git checkout "KoolKitty.txt"
$ git stash pop stash@{0}
$ git stash list
```

![Git-Stash-Pop](https://labex.io/upload/T/C/N/IkhZ2SL38pUH.jpg)

**Clearing Out Your Stash**

The following commands can be used to clear out your stash.

```
$ git stash drop <Stash Identifier>
```

Using `git stash drop` can be used to delete/remove a single stash list entry. Similarly, using `git stash clear` removes all stash list entries.

```
$ git stash clear
```

###2.7 Undoing Changes Made to Your Repository

For the next part of the lab, ensure you are working in your FabulousCat repository. Make a new simple text file as follows and commit it. Name your cat as you wish.

```
$ cd ~/Code/FabulousCat
$ vim CatName.txt
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Cat Name 1"
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/G/H/U/hWVBZl7u4zpl.jpg)

####2.7.1 Git Checkout

As we looked at in the first lab, git checkout has three main functions.

- Checking out files.
- Checking out commits.
- Checking out branches

For the purposes of this lab, the general syntax of the `git checkout` command is as follows.

```
$ git checkout <commit> <file>
```

**Checking Out a File**

Using `git checkout` for an individual file will basically retrieve the file from the local repository and copy it over its counterpart in the working directory. This means that it restores it to the state as it exists within the last commit of the local repository. Note that this process is permanent and should be handled with care.

Try it now. Rename your cat, then restore your cat's old name using `git checkout`.

```
$ echo "New Name" >  CatName.txt
$ git checkout CatName.txt
$ cat CatName.txt
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/M/W/T/2eDVrUlvMJMC.jpg)

**Checking Out an Old Commit**

You can also use `git checkout` to retrieve entire old commits. Modify your cat file again to change the name. Then commit it to the repository.

```
$ echo "New Name" >  CatName.txt
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Cat Name 2"
```

Now you cannot actually use git checkout to retrieve the original cat name, because it has already been committed.
So how can we get around this - checkout the entire last commit. You will need to use `git log` to get the <Commit ID> for our 'Cat Name 1' commit before doing this (this is best done using copy and paste).

(HINT: Press 'q' to exit the log file)

```
$ git log
$ git checkout <Commit ID>
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/D/O/S/GPiCwPe2lEPR.jpg)

![Commit-Checkout](https://labex.io/upload/G/K/I/yqy2ClGC6Yn3.jpg)

If you inspect the CatName.txt file, you will see that the cat name is now back to the original. 

Currently, you are in detached head mode, which means that you are not sitting on a branch, but instead are somewhere within the commit history (running `git status` will confirm this. From here, you can make commits and create a new branch from this point. Alternatively, to return the repository to the normal state, use `git checkout` to check out the branch that we were on (in our case, this was 'master').

Move back to the original head by using the following command (master is the branch name that we were on). Note, this is also how `git checkout` can me used to check out branches.

```
$ git status
$ git checkout master
$ git status
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/N/I/M/B3E0KptWkk5b.jpg)

If you check the CatName.txt file you will see that it has been updated again to the new name.

**Checking Out a File from a Previous Commit**

As you can see, the second (committed) name still remains in the most current directory. 

You can also checkout a single file from an old commit using this command (again, getting the Commit ID using git log).

```
$ git checkout  <Commit ID> CatName.txt
```

Now if you check the file, the original cat name will have been restored.

####2.7.2 Git Revert

Git revert is similar to checking out an old commit, however this command has more permanent results. What git revert does is takes changes from an old commit and makes a new commit based on the working directory, with those changes undone. This is important as it reverts the repository to an old state (in a permanent way) and still preserves your history (it is recomended to commit any current changes before reverting).

In short, `git revert` takes an old commit and generates a new commit that undoes all changes in the old commit with respect to the latest commit. Note that this won't affect files not featured in the old commit.

The usage of this command is as follows. Be aware that you may need to merge files or make commits first (this will be covered more in the next lab).

```
$ git revert <Commit ID>
```

####2.7.3 Git Reset

**Resetting the Staging Area**

`git reset` can be used for a number of functions (similar to `git checkout`). One such function is removing files from the staging area. 

Make some changes to any files in the working directory and stage them using `git add`. Then use `git reset` to remove them from the staging area. Experiment with this (you can compare the output of `git status` before and after resetting the staging area).

```
$ git reset
$ git reset <File Name>
```

As you may have figured out, specifying a file name removes an individual file whereas using the command without any file names simply removes all staged files.

Using git reset like this does not change the working directory contents (only the staging area).

**Resetting the Working Directory**

You can also use `git reset` to reset the working directory. This is essentially like using `git checkout` on all files in the working directory. That is, all files will be returned to the state they were in during the last commit. This action can be done by adding the --hard flag. Try it now, then check the files you modified above.

```
$ git reset --hard
```

**Altering the Commit History**

`git reset` can be used to modify the commit history as well. Using the following command, you can roll back the commit history to a specific commit. This is done without changing the working directory, so your files are still safe (although the commits are lost). Try it now, reset the history back to the 'Cat Name 2' commit, then run `git log` to verify that the latest commit is not 'Cat Name 2'.

```
$ git reset <Commit ID>
$ git log
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/K/F/P/UJkW6Xb1OAMt.jpg)

As you can see, the commit history has been erased. This allows users to reconstruct the commit history as they see fit. At this point, none of your working directory files should be changed.

**Moving Back Through Commit History**

You can also alter the working directory when rolling back through the commit history. This reverts the commit history AND working directory back to the state it was in at a previous commit. The history of all commits after this are lost permanently, so be careful!

As it was done before, modifying the working directory is done using the `--hard` flag.

```
$ git reset <Commit ID> --hard
```

Try it in your repository. Use git log to obtain the ID for the 'Cat Name 1' commit. Reset the repository back to this state. Look at the `git log` output and contents of your CatName.txt file. It should contain the original cat name. This indicates that your working directory has been modified.

###2.8 Other Git Commands/Features

####2.8.1 Git Status

We won't spend a lot of time on this command because it is pretty straight forward. We have seen this countless times before.

Basically, the purpose of `git status` is to show you what is happening in your repository with regards to any changes that have been made since the last commit. It also distinguishes the staged changes and the unstaged ones, as well as provide useful information on branches and heads).

```
$ git status
```

####2.8.2 Git Log

As with `git status`, we have also seen the `git log` command multiple times throughout this lab. However there are a few ways to customize the output.

Git log basically returns details of all the commits in the repository history. They are arranged chronologically with the most recent commit first.

```
$ git log
```

The following table lists some additions (that can be added to the end of the command above) to customize the output.

| Command Ending (git log) | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -n < Limit >             | This command is used to specify the number of commits that `git log` will display. |
| - -oneline               | This condenses the output of the command so that the identifier of each commit and their message are displayed on one line. |
| - - stat                 | Include additional information on the files that were altered. |
| -p                       | Includes the full diff output of each commit (ie. a patch representing each commit). |
| < Since >..< Until >     | Only displays the commits between two points. These can be any kind of revision reference (eg. a commit ID, branch name, HEAD, etc.) |
|< File >|Only displays commits including the File specified.

Try some of the above commands eg. `$ git log -n 3` to explore the functionality of git log.

####2.8.3 Git Diff

This command is used to identify differences between files in the working directory with their counterparts in thee repository (line by line). This is particularly useful when you are preparing merges (which will be discussed in the next lab). You can specify the file name if desired or leave it empty (to view all file differences).

```
$ git diff <File Name>
```

For example, modify the CatName.txt file in your repository to give your cat a surname. Then run the following command.

```
$ git diff CatName.txt
```

####2.8.4 Git Clean

This command is essentially used to remove all untracked files from a working directory. This is a permanent process, so be careful. Note that any ignored files (see the next section) will not be removed unless explicitly specified.

You can use the `-n` flag to do a 'dry run' which will inform you as to what will be removed without actually removing it.


```
$ git clean -n
```

To actually remove files, you must use the `-f` flag.

```
$ git clean -f
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/R/H/V/KaL9a5Z19MnN.jpg)

The following `git clean` command extensions offer further options.

| Extension   | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -f < path > | Conduct the clean operation, but limit it to a specified path. |
| -df         | Remove both untracked files and untracked directories.       |
| -xf         | Perform the cleaning action and remove ignored files as well. |

Try it yourself, make some empty files in your FabulousCat repository and experiment with the `git clean` command.

####2.8.5 Ignoring Files

Telling git to ignore files and paths is very similar to configuring a repository. It can also be done at both local and global levels, however there is no dedicated Git command for doing so.

'Configurations' for ignoring files are stored in `.gitignore` files.

At a local level, this file is stored in `.git/info/exclude` ('exclude' is the actual file). You can edit this with a text editor such as *vim*.

In order to create global ignore rules, you must create a `.gitignore` file and configure Git to use it. This can be done with the following commands (this process creates it in your home directory).

```
$ touch ~/.gitignore
$ git config --global core.excludesFile ~/.gitignore
```

In this tutorial we will only be setting local ignore rules, but the process is the same for global rules (just editing a different file).

**Ignoring a File**

First, open your local `.gitignore` file in a text editor.
```
$ vim .git/info/exclude
```
Next, add two lines as shown in the picture. This will cause Git to ignore all .txt files and any files with the name script.py. Note that the `*` character can be used as a wildcard. Ignore rules also support file paths.

![](https://labex.io/upload/R/H/V/tCb8EHej6vJo.jpg)

Next, create some new files as shown below.

```
$ touch ignored.txt
$ touch still_ignored.txt
$ touch script.py
$ touch visible.py
```

Now, run `git status`, the only file that Git will see is `visible.py`.repositoryrepository

![](https://labex.io/upload/V/T/G/pFqeBuTBshzR.jpg)

Try to use git add to add the `ignored.txt` file. You will find that Git will not allow it.

**Staging an Ignored File**

You can still make Git stage a file for committing by using the `-f` flag. Try it below, then check `git status`.

```
$ git add -f .
$ git status
```
As you can see, now even the ignored files are staged. These can be committed normally.

Similarly, you can also stash an ignored file using the `--all` flag.
