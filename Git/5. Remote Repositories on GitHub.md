# Remote Repositories on GitHub

##Introduction

At the end of the last lab, we looked at using remote repositories, but used a local bare repository to demonstrate the concept. In this lab, we will expand on this concept as we learn more about GitHub, a dedicated hosting platform for remote repositories. We will also walk you through the process of signing up to GitHub (if you haven't already) and creating/using a remote repository. It will also act as a final review of all the Git content we have learned so far.

###Learning Objectives

- Understand the difference between Git and GitHub.
- Sign up to GitHub and understand the process of creating a new repository.
- Understand the different ways that you can connect to a GitHub repository.
- Become familiar with the GitHub user interface.
- Understand the various ways that you can connect to a remote repository.
- Understand the process of accessing and using branches in GitHub.
- Understand how we can modify our repository contents.


## 1. Git vs GitHub

Before we continue, let's first clarify the difference between Git and GitHub.

A common misconception for beginners is that Git and GitHub are the same thing. In reality, they couldn't be more different from one another.

Git, like we have established, is a version control system. You use it on your local computer to track changes in your code during a development project.

GitHub, on the other hand, is an online platform that is dedicated to hosting data repositories that software like Git creates. Thus, it can be equated to an online space where we can store a remote repository. This is particularly useful for projects that have multiple collaborators in different places.

GitHub IS NOT Git!


## 2. Signing Up To GitHub and Creating a Repository

This next part of the tutorial will guide you through creating an account in GitHub (although it is relatively straight forward). If you are comfortable on to do this on your own, or you already have a GitHub account, feel free to skip to the next section.
> As there is no connection to WLAN in our environment, so we are sorry to say that you can't access the internet, but you can do it on your own computer by all the steps we'll show you.

First, you will need to open Firefox in your live environment and visit the [official GitHub Website](https://github.com/) at the following link.

```
https://github.com/
```

![GitHub Home](https://labex.io/upload/Y/V/W/dB2e56E4WWmx.png)

### 2.1 Creating an account

In order to create a GitHub account, you will need a valid email address that you can access easily.

If you already have an account, you can log in. Otherwise, fill in the fields on the homepage as appropriate (as shown below). Note that this is not a real email address in the example.

![Sign Up Credentials](https://labex.io/upload/B/W/N/IMpKGoyUgMM5.png)

Good! Next you will be presented with the following screen.

![GitHub Plan Options](https://labex.io/upload/E/B/U/KXWF9wAx9F0l.png)


### 2.2 Public vs Private Repositories

As you can see, you have two options under where you are prompted to 'choose your personal plan'.

GitHub is essentially a free service, however you can also sign up for a paid plan. The key difference between these two options is that having a paid plan will allow you to create private repositories.

Hence, as you may have guessed, when you are using GitHub's free plan, you can only create public repositories. This means that any repository you create will be publicly viewable and accessible. However, only those with appropriate privileges will be able to write to a public repository.

For this tutorial, just ensure that the 'free' option is selected (it should be by default). Don't worry, you can upgrade at any time.

Also be aware that there are other platforms that may allow the hosting of private repositories for free, however they will not be covered in this tutorial.

Finally, you will see the following screen.

![Tailored Experience](https://labex.io/upload/X/K/Q/KIpRwhhFwaPr.png)

You have the option to provide Git with some personal details that may help you when joining the GitHub community. Feel free to fill these out, or just skip it.

#### The Final Step

There is only one more thing for you to do when signing up to GitHub, which is not completely apparent. By now, GitHub should have sent you an email with a verification link. In order to complete your GitHub registration, you will need to open this email and click on the link.

You will need to complete the verification process before you can create a repository (if possible, try to open your email in the same browser). There may be a brief delay until verification is completed.

Congratulations, by now you should have made a GitHub account! Welcome to the world of software development.

### 2.3 Creating Your First GitHub Repository

If all was successful, logging in to GitHub should bring up a screen such as the one below. In order to create a new repository, click on the `+` icon on the top right corner of your interface (as circled on the image).


![GitHub Home Logged In](https://labex.io/upload/B/F/R/Kuj8bsIlQpdZ.png)

From the dropdown menu that appears, select 'New Repository'. As you can see, you also have the option to import an existing repository(but for this tutorial, we will make a new one).

Once you have elected to start a 'New Repository', the following screen (or something similar) should appear provided that your verification was successful (We will create a repository use another Github account).

![New Repo Options](https://labex.io/upload/D/E/F/69RT7HONBGlh.jpg)



As shown, call your repository 'Hello-World' and make sure it is a public repository (don't panic, you can delete this repository when you're done). Then, hit the 'create repository' button.

![New Repository](https://labex.io/upload/Y/U/P/nLIz9BZlhv6a.jpg)

Congratulations! You have just created your first remote repository in GitHub.

## 3. Connecting Your Local Repository to a GitHub Remote Repository

### 3.1 Adding Data to Your first Repository

As you can see, the repository you have just created is empty. GitHub has also provided a series of commands you can execute in a command line in order to fill it with a new project (or an existing one). In this tutorial, we will use an existing one.

Leave Firefox open for the time being, but bring up you command line interface. Let's create a new repository.

```
$ cd ~/Code/
$ git init Hello-World && cd Hello-World
$ echo 'Hello World' >> HelloWorld.txt
$ git add HelloWorld.txt
$ git commit -m 'Initial Commit'
```

If you were wondering what the `echo 'Hello World' >> HelloWorld.txt` command does, it simply adds the line of text specified after `echo` into the filename specified after the `>>` (and create the file if it does not exist).

Good! Now that we have some data in our repository, it is time to create a remote to our new repository. For our remote URL, we will be using the `HTTPS://` protocol, just to keep things simple.

Go back you your Firefox window and copy the URL of your repository (it should be copied from the box circled in red in the image below). If your `HTTPS://` URL does not end with `.git` you are most likely copying it from the wrong place.

![URL Location](https://labex.io/upload/Y/U/P/nLIz9BZlhv6a.jpg)

### 3.2 Our Remote

Now, back in your terminal window execute the following command. Remember from the last lab, `git remote` can be used to create a connection to the repository found at the URL specified. We will call our remote 'origin'.

```
$ git remote add origin <URL>
$ git remote -v
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/G/A/Y/pqY434lQyvMF.jpg)

As you can see by the output, we have created a remote to our GitHub (remote) repository. We can now use this remote to make our first push to the GitHub repository!

### 3.3 Our First Push

In order to make our first push, use the following command. You may notice that we are also using the `-u` flag. All this basically does is tell Git that we want to keep our remote and local branches in sync with each other. 

We are pushing the master branch of our repository.

You will also be required to enter your GitHub username and password. Do this where appropriate, followed by the return key.

```
$ git push -u origin master
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/P/F/A/v0NWye5H90uP.jpg)

Congratulations! You have just made your first push to a GitHub repository. Go back to Firefox and refresh your GitHub tab. You will see that your file is now visible. Click on it to view its contents.

![](https://labex.io/upload/N/K/X/7GghKDgGRrIk.jpg)

You can also see that GitHub tells you how many commits have been made and how many different branches there are in the repository.

#### Another Push

Back in your command line, add some contents to your repository and make another commit.

```
$ mkdir SomeFiles
$ touch SomeFiles/file
$ touch AnotherFile
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Added some stuff'
```

Now push it to your repository. Note that now you don't need to include the `-u` flag.

```
$ git push origin master
```

Perfect! Go back to Firefox and refresh your browser tab.

![](https://labex.io/upload/J/T/D/dmBFRZZ7stXW.jpg)


As you can see, the GitHub page has updated again!

### 3.4 Branches in GitHub

Recall our last lab where we learned about development branches in Git. Well guess what - GitHub supports branches too!

#### Creating Branches

Before we start, let's create a new branch in our local repository.

```
$ git branch NewBranch
$ git checkout NewBranch
```

Now, add a new file to your working directory and commit the change to the local repository.

```
$ echo 'A random file' >> NewBranchFile
$ git add NewBranchFile
$ git commit -m 'Commit to a new branch'
```

Good! To recap, what we just did was create a new branch, switch to it and make a new commit exclusively to this new branch.

Now we are ready to push it to our GitHub repository. In order to do so, we must specifically push the new branch instead of the master.

As we did before, you will need to enter your GitHub login credentials.

```
$ git push origin NewBranch
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/B/H/J/thcdSXcvEZHD.jpg)


As you can see, Git has created a new branch in the remote repository and added data from the local repository. If you go back to your GitHub page and refresh it, you will see that you now have 2 branches. Note that you can switch which branch is being viewed using the dropdown menu (indicated by the red ring on the image).

![Master Branch GitHub](media/Master-Branch-GitHub.jpg)


![New Branch GitHub](https://labex.io/upload/R/Y/B/1Gg1tep843LU.jpg)

Congratulations! You have successfully sent a new branch to the GitHub repository.

#### Merging Branches

Notice that GitHub is telling us that our 'NewBranch' is 1 commit ahead of our master. Well we can merge them too using Git to merge them as we normally would. Use the following commands to merge your 'NewBranch' into 'master' then push the new version of 'master' to your remote repository.

```
$ git checkout master
$ git merge NewBranch
$ git push origin master
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/W/C/K/GdkYDrcdgQe6.jpg)

Now if you look at your GitHub page (the 'NewBranch' one), you will see that this message has changed. The two branches are in sync with one another. 

The files shown on the master branch page will have been updated accordingly.

![Synced NewBranch](https://labex.io/upload/X/M/U/6I8zHc1J0jPA.jpg)


### 3.5 Accessing Remote Branches Using Git Fetch

Thus far, we have moved data to the remote repository. Obviously we also need to be able to move data in the opposite direction (ie. bring it into our local repository). 

How can we do this? With `git fetch` and `git pull` of course!

To demonstrate, create a new repository and change into it.

```
$ cd ~/Code
$ git init SecondRepo && cd SecondRepo
```

Next, we'll need to make an initial commit so that we have a master branch to actually work with.

```
$ touch firstfile
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Initial Commit'
```

We will also need to create a new branch and switch the HEAD over to its tip.

```
$ git branch NewBranch2
$ git checkout Newbranch2
```

Finally, we need to add a new remote to our GitHub repository. The URL can be found on your repository homepage if you click the 'clone or download' button (as shown). If your URL does not end with `.git` you are likely getting it from the wrong place.

![](https://labex.io/upload/S/E/C/FEfNBr8lWYsa.jpg)


Create a remote as follows. Again, we'll just call it origin.

```
$ git remote add origin <URL>
```

At this point, we have two options. First we will demonstrate the use of 'git fetch`. Check the branches available in your repository.

```
$ git branch -a
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/F/Q/G/1Kox7F0HXCK3.jpg)


As you can see, we have two available branches (that we just created). What we want to do now is import branches from the remote repository as *remote branches*. Use `git fetch` to retrieve both branches from the GitHub repository.

```
$ git fetch origin master
$ git fetch origin NewBranch
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/I/C/U/fU3RzRI7iLES.jpg)


Good! As you can see, `git fetch` has retrieved the branches we asked for. To confirm, use the following command (don't forget the `-a` tag because it forces Git to show remote branches too).

```
$ git branch -a
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/Q/U/S/7I3TIOh8r2dA.jpg)

As you can see, our use of `git fetch` was successful.

At this point, we have only retrieved the branches. In our local repository, they are only stored as remote branches (hence why they are red). We now need to merge these branches into our working branches.

When your HEAD is on 'NewBranch2' (as it should be already), run the following command to merge your remote branch into your local branch. Once you have done this, list the contents of the working directory. Also note that an editor will open and prompt for a commit message during this process.

```
$ git merge origin/NewBranch
$ ls
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/O/I/P/sOD0R6pQ41VN.jpg)

As you can see, we have merged the contents of our 'NewBranch' branch in the GitHub repository into the 'NewBranch2' branch of our new local repository.

### 3.6 Accessing Remote Branches Using Git Pull

Recall from the last lab where we discussed the differences between `git pull` and `git fetch`. Both are used to retrieve data from a repository through a remote. The difference is that `git pull` obtains the remote branches (by using `git fetch`) and merges them at the same time.

`git pull` = `git fetch` + `git merge`

This speeds the whole process up considerably. Let's merge our GitHub 'master' branch into our local 'master' branch using `git pull`.
:wq
```
$ git checkout master
$ git pull origin master
$ ls
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/V/U/W/FT6zTmvQfzrX.jpg)

As you can see, this process was much faster and updated the master branch working directory in the exact same way that using `git fetch` and `git merge` did.

In this example we used `git pull` and `git fetch` to merge changes into a repository that was practically empty. However, in a real project, `git pull` and/or `git fetch` are generally used to keep local repositories up to date with the remote one. Thus, if a team member makes a change to the data, all other team members can use these commands to update their copies so that they include this change.

### 3.7 Cloning a Repository

Before, we basically just merged branches into a new repository. Generally this isn't necessarily the best use of `git pull` and `git fetch`, though it was fine for the purposes of an example.

You may have already realized this, but there is a much easier way to *clone* a remote repository. Yep, you guessed it! We can use `git clone`.

`git clone` will automatically initialize a new repository and import the contents (including branches) into it. Try it now (after moving back to your home directory).

```
$ cd ~/Code
$ git clone <URL> HWClone
$ cd HWClone
$ ls
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/E/A/K/Q2bK1j5uUOck.jpg)

As you can see, Git has added all the contents of the GitHub repository into the newly created local repository.

What about the branchces and remote though? Well, let's look at that now. Run the following commands to list all the remotes and branches in this repository.

```
$ git remote -v
$ git branch -a
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/A/M/X/F9Mh4oZic09I.jpg)

As you can see, the `git clone` command has automatically created a remote named `origin` which points back to the repository that we sourced the current one from (our GitHub repository).

All remote repository branches have been included as well. However, the only non-remote branch we have in the repository is our master branch. The rest (ie. 'NewBranch') are still only in there as remote branches.

A quick, easy and painless way to solve this dilemma is to use `git checkout`. This is because `git checkout` can also be used to switch the HEAD over to remote branches. Try it now, then, list all branches again.

```
$ git checkout NewBranch
$ git branch -a
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/R/X/X/wVr8Cwdvmgx9.jpg)

As you can see, 'NewBranch' has automatically become a regular non-remote branch in our local repository. You can now work, push and pull with these branches to your heart's content.


## 4. A Quick Note About the GitHub Interface.

A very common misconception for those who are new to remote repositories, on platforms such as GitHub, is that the repository homepage can be used as a working directory.

![](https://labex.io/upload/B/W/J/3M2AZr9aJ8aB.jpg)


This is not true. The repository homepage IS NOT A WORKING DIRECTORY. You can view the files in your repository; however you cannot modify them in any way. The view you are seeing is basically just a snapshot of the repository contents of a given commit. A 'preview' if you will.

This is because the GitHub repository is a remote repository, and a remote repository is usually a bare repository. By definition a bare repository does not have a working directory (remember this from labs 2 and 3).

You may have even noticed that the file name at the end of the URL has the `.git` extension, just like a bare repository does by convention. Your GitHub repository is just a bare repository on a server.

If you want to modify the 'directory' shown on the GitHub page, you need to modify your local version, then push those changes. Try it below from the repository that we cloned.

```
$ git checkout master
$ mkdir MoreFiles
$ mv NewBranchFile MoreFiles
$ mv AnotherFile RegularFile
$ rm -rf SomeFiles
```

For those of you unfamiliar with Linux and BaSH, these commands will do the following:

- Switch the HEAD back to 'master'.
- Make a new directory called 'MoreFiles'.
- Move 'NewBranchFile' into 'MoreFiles'.
- Remane 'AnotherFile' to 'RegularFile'.
- Delete the 'SomeFiles' directory.

Commit these changes.

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Changed some stuff'
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/Q/G/P/vK7kMnpUrpM7.jpg)


Finally, push this new commit to your GitHub repository.

```
$ git push origin master
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/Q/G/J/ytOIpnJd06Pf.jpg)

Good! Now go back to your browser and update your GitHub page.

![](https://labex.io/upload/K/W/I/5q0kYdVTDRhD.jpg)

As you can see, the preview of your repository files has been changed.

Therefore, the only way to modify the repository preview on GitHub is to modify the contents in of your working directory, commit the changes and push it to your remote.

## 5. Summary

Congratulations! You have successfully finished this introductory course to Git! For more information on Git, you can consult the [official documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs).

Good luck in all your future software development endeavours!
