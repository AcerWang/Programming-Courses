# A Post-tax Salary Calculator

## Introduction

*Note: all formulas and numbers are made up only for the sake of this exercise; please do not use this to calculate your real life personal tax.*

To refine the previous personal tax calculator which now can calculate multi-salaries and print out their post-tax salaries.

Modification Required：

1. Output of post-tax salary

2. Deduction of social insurance expenditure during the calculation
3. Enable multi-person to calculate at the same time
4. Print out the list of post-tax salary

Formula of individual tax：

1. Taxable income amount = salary - social insurance premiums - starting points ($3,500)
2. Tax payable = taxable income × tax rate － quick calculation deduction

We need to calculate social insurance premiums in this program. Since formulas vary from places to places, we adopt the standard from a city uniformly. The proportion of the salary is as follows ：

* Endowment Insurance：8%
* Medical Insurance：2%
* Unemployment Insurance：0.5%
* Employment Injury Insurance：0%
* Maternity Insurance：0%
* Provident Fund：6%

Attention: we give no consideration on social security payment base, just use salaries to calculate.

Table of tax rate and quick deductions：

For example, salary is 5,000, then Insurance and Housing Fund is 825, taxable income is 675 (5,000-825-3,500); tax payable is 20.25（675*%3 - 0); Post-tax salary is 4,154.75（5,000-825-20.25). 

Input should follow this format: `job_number: salary job_number: salary`. Python3 execution is as follows：

```
$ ./calculator.py 101:3500 203:5000 309:15000
101:2922.50
203:4154.75
309:11273.75
```

Note the parameter may be more than one, and it is the job number or the salary that is an integer. In your program, you can use thses number like this sys.argv[0], which is[101:3500], so you need to handle these.
If the amount of parameter is inaccurate or not integer, you are required to print out the following line：

```
print("Parameter Error")
```

## Goal

To complete the task you need to achieve these：

1. Save the program to `/home/labex/calculator.py`
2. The program could handle more than one employe's salary. The output is in one or more lines, and each is in the form of `job number: post-tax salary`
3. Post-tax salary needs to keep two decimals after returned. If it is an integer, it should in the form of `xxx.00`.

## Tips

* To change parameters into integer you can use  `int()`; if it cannot turn into integer correctly such as （ int('abcd')). you need to deal with the exception and print out the error information above.
* Output with two places of decimal can use the function format of the string.
* To get argument, use  `sys.argv` from sys module. `sys.argv[0]` is the script name, `sys.argv[1]` is the first parameter. 
* Example：

```
import sys

print(sys.argv)
```

* Handling of multi-parameters can use a list or direct to save; calculate and output workers' information.
* It would be easier to use if you write the calculation of social insurance and personal tax in the form of function.


Finally, because these code will be required for the following challenges, please use `download code` at the center top in the environment to save it to your computer or submit to your Github.
