# Realization of Personal Tax Calculator

##Introduction

Our goal is to develop a personal tax calculator. When we enter our wages, it will print out personal tax payable.

*note: all scenarios are made up solely for ths use of this lab.  Please do not use this formula to calculate your real personal tax payable.* 

Formula of personal tax:

1. Taxable income = Wage － Social insurance premiums - threshold ($3,500)
2. Tax payable = Taxable income × Tax rate － quick calculation deduction

We give no consideration and set social insurance premiums as 0 in this program.

Table of tax rate and quick deduction:

For example, if wage is 5,000, then the taxable income is $1,500, (5,000-3,500), tax payable is 45, (1500 x 3% - 0). 

Python 3 execution:

```
$ cd /home/labex
$ ./calculator.py 3500
0.00
$ ./calculator.py 5000
45.00
$ ./calculator.py 15000
1870.00
```

Pay attention here. Only one parameter in the program needs execution, and it is wage, which means the number is an integer. The command line: `$ ./calculator.py 3500`, here 3500 is a parameter, which is passed to `calculator.py`, in the program, you can use it by means of sys.argv[1].
If the parameter is inaccurate or cannot be changed into integer, you need to print out the following line:

```
print("Parameter Error")
```

Attention. The number of wage is considered as parameter, so do not use `input` to acquire information; otherwise, you will exceed time limit when submitting your result.

## Objective

You are required to achieve the following goals to fulfill your mission:

1. Save the program to `/home/labex/calculator.py`
2. The first parameter in execution is the number of wage, that is  `./calculator.py 3500`
3. Reserve two decimal fractions when returning, if it is an integer, it should be in the form of `xxx.00`.

## Tips

1. You can change parameters into integers, using `int()`, and if it cannot change correctly (like int('abcd')), you need to deal with the exception and print out the error information mentioned above.
2. Keep two decimal of your output and you can use function format from character strings.
3. To get argument is to use `sys.argv` from sys module. Specifically, `sys.argv[0]` is the name of script, and `sys.argv[1]` is the first parameter. For example：

```
import sys

print(sys.argv)
```
