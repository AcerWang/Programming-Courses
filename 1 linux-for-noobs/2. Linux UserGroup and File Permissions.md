# Linux User/Group and File Permissions

## 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Content

Operating steps in this lab will teach you how to learn Linux user and group management through practices, as well as several key points pertinent to file permissions.

#### 1.2 Key Points

- Linux user management
- User group management
- File permissions

## 2. User Management

By learning the first lab, you should already know that Linux is a multi-user operating system. For example, Bob and Alex can visit the same host. They share some of the host resources, but they also have their own user spaces to store their own files. In fact, their files are placed on the same physical disk, even on the same logical partition or directory. Because of Linux user management and authority management, different users cannot easily modify others' files.

Next, let's start learning the basics of user management with Linux.

### 2.1 To Print User Information

Please open the terminal and enter the following command：

```
$ who am i

or

$ who mom likes
```

![image desc1](https://labex.io/upload/Q/K/C/krCEOkpfqHSg.jpeg)

The first column of the output indicates the user name of the user who opened the current pseudo terminal. If you want to view the user name of the currently logged-in user, you can remove the space and use `whoami` directly. The `pts` in the second column represents the pseudo terminal. The so-called pseudo terminal is relative to the `/dev/tty`devices. In the previous section, we've talked about seven `/dev/tty` devices which can be switched using `[Ctrl]`+`[Alt]`+`[F1]〜[F7]`. Actually, they are real terminals. Whenever you use `/dev/tty7` in the graphical interface to open a terminal, you will create a pseudo-terminal. The number 0 in the `pts/0` is a serial number. You can try to open another terminal, and then enter `who am i`. You will find that the second column becomes `pts/1`. The third column indicates the boot time of the current pseudo terminal.

Parameters of `who`:

| Parameter | Description                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `-a`      | Print all information                              |
| `-d`      | Print dead process                                 |
| `-m`      | Same as `am i`,`mom likes`                         |
| `-q`      | Get number of users logged in and their user names |
| `-u`      | Get the list of users logged in                    |
| `-r`      | Get the current run level                          |

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'who\s+am\s+i' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "who am i" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.2 Create Users

In the Linux system, the `root` account has the supreme right of the entire system, such as creating/adding users.

> Root permission is a kind of system privilege, equivalent to SYSTEM privilege, but higher than Administrator privileges. Root is the super administrator user account in Linux and UNIX systems. The account has the supreme power of the entire system, hence he can operate all subjects in the system. When hackers invade the system, they usually elevate the authority to root authority. To understand it in a Windows way, it is to add one's own illegal account to the Administrators users group. Or, in the Android operating system (based on the Linux kernel), the acquisition of root privileges means the highest permission and authority of that mobile phone, and then you can add, delete, modify or search for any file (including system files) in the phone. We usually log in to the system as a regular account. If you want to create a user, you need root privileges. `sudo` can get root privileges for you. However, using `sudo` command needs two requirements:
> 1. The password of the user logged in;
> 2. The user must be in the `sudo` user group.

#### su, su- and sudo 

Using command `su <a>` can switch to user a. To execute this command, you need to enter the password for this user. You can run the `cmd` command at the privilege level by using `sudo <cmd>`, requiring the current user to belong to the sudo group and entering the current user's password.

The command `su - <user>` is to switch users, while the environment variable will be changed.

Now, we create a new user called "jack":

```
$ sudo adduser jack
```

The default user `labex` do not need to enter the password to execute `sudo`. In this part, you need to follow the prompts to enter labex password. (**Linux password input does not show any content.**) Then you can give "jack“ a password. Some options you can choose from to use the default value.

This command not only adds the user to the system, but also creates the home directory for the new user:

```
$ ls /home
```

You have created a user, and you can log in with the new account. Please use the following command to log in:

```
$ su -l jack
```

Enter the password you just set up for "jack".

If you want to exit the current user, you can use `exit` command or use the shortcut `Ctrl + d`.

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'adduser' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "adduser" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.3 User Group


In Linux, each user has a home (user group). A user group is a collection of users who share some resources and permissions, and have private resources. This kind of structure is similar to a family structure. Your brothers and sisters (different users) belong to the same family (user group), and you share all resources within this particular family (shared resources) and parents treat you all the same (shared permissions). You can write Diary which others cannot view without permission (private resources and permissions). Of course, a user can belong to multiple user groups, such as you belong to the family, but also belong to a school or a company.

How to see user group name？

#### Method 1：Use `groups` Command 

```
$ groups labex
```

![image desc4](https://labex.io/upload/S/V/E/g3OrayABYz0w.jpeg)


As shown in the figure, the word before `:` is the user name and the words after `:` are the group names for this user. Here you can see that LabEx user belongs to LabEx group. Each time when you create a new user, if you do not specify a user group, the command will automatically create a user group that has the same name as the user name. By default, the sudo user group can use the `sudo` command to get root privileges. LabEx user can also use the `sudo` command. You can view the `/etc/sudoers.d/labex` file. We have created this file in the `/etc/sudoers.d` directory to give `sudo` permissions to user label:

![image desc5](https://labex.io/upload/I/J/G/2dBD1sfBoaTr.jpeg)

#### Method 2：View `/etc/group` File 

```
$ cat /etc/group | sort
```

The command `cat` is used to read the contents of the specified file and print it out.`| sort` means that the text is sorted and output by dict sort (dictionary sort). You will see an output listing. And, you can see LabEx user group information near the bottom of the listing:

![image desc6](https://labex.io/upload/M/I/M/PDo71i1aLhja.jpeg)

If you do not find it, it doesn't matter. You can use the following command to filter out some of the results you do not want to see:

```
$ cat /etc/group | grep -E "labex"
```

![image desc7](https://labex.io/upload/D/V/K/oFa57jsYvmns.jpeg)

##### The description of `/etc/group` :

The contents of `/etc/group` include user groups, user group passwords, GIDs and users in the groups. Each user group has a record. The format is as follows:

>group_name:password:GID:user_list 

##### Add other users to the sudo user group

By default, newly created users do not have root privileges, nor are they in the sudo user group. You can invite them to join the sudo user group to get root privileges:

```
$ su -l jack
$ sudo ls
```
After the execution of the commands, it will warn that "jack" is not in the sudoers file.

You can use the command `usermod` to add a user to a user group. You must have root privileges to use this command. You can use the root user to add other users to user group directly or use one of the users from sudo group to use the `sudo` command to get permission to execute the commands.

We use the LabEx user to execute the sudo command to add “jack” to the sudo user group so that it can also get root privileges using the `sudo` command:

```
$ exit
$ sudo groups jack
$ sudo usermod -G sudo jack
$ sudo groups jack
```

Then you switch back to “jack”, and now you can use `sudo` to get root privileges.
```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'groups' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "groups" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.4 To Delete Users

Deleting a user is very easy:

```
$ sudo deluser jack --remove-home
```

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'deluser' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "deluser" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
## 3. File Permissions
- To view file permissions
- To change ownership of file
- To modify file permissions

### 3.1 To View File Permissions

We have used `ls` many times. We use it to list and display the files of the current directory. It can do a lot more than that if we give it some parameters. Now we have to use it to view the file permissions.

List files in _long_ format:

```
$ ls -l
```

![image desc9](https://labex.io/upload/V/U/C/G5XvChjYhfTV.jpeg)

Except the value in the last column, i.e., the file name, you may not be familiar with others.

So what are the file type, file permissions, links and last modified time?

- file type

  > For file type, there is one thing you have to keep in mind that everything in Linux is file.

- file permissions

  Read permission (r): 

  > You can use `cat <file name>` to read the contents of a file;

  Write permission (w): 

  > You can edit and modify a file;

  Execute permission (x): 

  > It refers to a binary program file or script file that can be run, like an `exe` file on Windows. You need to pay attention to the fact that a directory with both read and execute permissions can open and view the contained files. Only the directories with write permission are allowed to create other files in them.

- number of links

> The number of files linked to the `inode`. (inode is related to the concept of Linux file system, not covered in this course; if you're interested, you can learn on your own.)

- file size

>The node size to represent the file size, you can give `ls` command the `-lh` parameter to  view the file size.

After understanding some concepts of file permissions, we list other common uses of the `ls` command:

- To display all files except the `.` (current directory) and `..` (parent directory):

```
$ ls -A
```

![image desc12](https://labex.io/upload/H/R/B/M7VQcCUZbVrX.jpeg)

- To use both the -A and -l parameters together:

```
$ ls -Al
```

- To view the full properties of a directory:

```
$ ls -dl <directory>
```

- To show all the file sizes:

```
$ ls -AsSh
```

's' is used for the display file size.

'S' is used for sorting file by file size.

if you need to know how to sort by other ways, please use the "man" command.

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'ls' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "ls" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 3.2 To Change the Owner of a File


We log in as "jack". Then create a new file named "iphonex":

```
$ touch iphonex
```

The file owner is jack:

![image desc13](https://labex.io/upload/I/R/N/gRxnqlWvJ7US.jpeg)

Then we switch the user to "labex" . We can use the following command to change the file owner for "labex":

```
$ cd /home/jack
$ ls iphonex
$ sudo chown labex iphonex
```

 Find the file owner modified successfully for labex:

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/V/O/P/3lm0rsoWwFfn.jpeg)

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'chown' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "chown" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 3.3 To Modify File Permissions

If there is a document you do not want other users to read, write or execute, you need to modify the permissions of the file. There are two ways:

- Method 1：Binary number representation

Each file has three groups of permissions (owner, user group, others) corresponding to a "rwx" triplet. The file "iphonex" permissions are changed to "only for owner to use":

In order to demonstrate, we write some words into the file：

```
$ echo "echo \"hello labex\"" > iphonex
```

 Then modify the permissions:

```
$ chmod 700 iphonex
```

Now, other users are unable to read this "iphonex" file.


- Method 2：Addition and subtraction assignments

You can use the following command to achieve the same result as by method 1:

```
$ chmod go-rw iphonex
```


`u`, `g` and `o` respectively represent user (file owner), group and others. `+` and `-` represent to add and remove the corresponding permissions.

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'chmod' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "chmod" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
## 4. Addition

What is the difference between `useradd` and `adduser`?

The command `useradd` can only create the user. After that, we need to use `passwd` to set up password for the new user. The command `adduser` not noly creates a user, but also creates a directory, and a password. 

Linux also has some content on the hidden permissions and special permissions. You can learn that as an extracurricular coursework.


## 5. Homework

Please finish the tasks:

1. Create a new user named `labextest`. 
2. Create new file `/opt/forlabex`. 
3. Grant the user `labextest ` permissions to write and read the file. 

**Tip**: How do you create a file? You can consider the `touch` command, which can create an empty file.
