# Software Installation

## 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Content

This Lab will introduce several ways (`apt`, `dpkg` ) to install a software on Ubuntu.

#### 1.2 Key Points

There are usually four ways to install a software on Linux:

- Online installation
- Install the deb package from disk
- Install from binary package
- Compile the installation from source code

The following will introduce the first three methods. You will learn the last one in the Linux programming course.

## 2. Explanation

In Windows, if you want to install a software, you need to download the corresponding software's online installation package, and then keep clicking "next step“. It is relatively easier and simpler to install a software on Linux. You just need to type a single command. Before learning this kind of installation, it is necessary to note that there are some differences in the online installations of different Linux distributions, including the use of commands and their package management tools. Because our development environment is based on Ubuntu, what is taught here - online installation - will only apply to Ubuntu distribution, or other systems based on Ubuntu release. Ubuntu is based on the debian release, which uses the debian package management tool dpkg, so some operations are also applicable with debian. In some other distributions, they use other package management tools such as redhat, centos, fedora, and etc., and will not be applicable (redhat and centos use rpm).

**Non-member users cannot connect to the external network. If the online installation process requires connection from the external network, then it will not be able to install successfully.**

### 2.1 Experiment

For example, we want to install a software called w3m (w3m is a simple web browser on the command line), then enter the following command:

```
$ sudo apt-get install w3m
```

Let's take a look at the command execution:

![image desc1](https://labex.io/upload/S/Y/G/Z1hwzb9Em9Ns.jpeg)

```
$ w3m www.github.com
```

**If you cannot use TAB to complete this command after you install a software, you can try executing ‘source ~ / .zshrc’ first, and then you can use it.**

### 2.2 apt package management tool 

> APT is an abbreviation for Advance Packaging Tool, a package manager for Debian and its derivative releases. APT can automatically download, configure, and install binary or source code packages, thus simplifying the management of Unix systems Software process. APT was first designed as dpkg front end, used to deal with deb format of the package. Now since APT-RPM organization has modified it, APT can be installed in support of RPM system management RPM package. This package manager contains multiple tools that start with apt-, such as apt-get apt-cache apt-cdrom, and etc., used in the Debian series of distributions.


When you run the installation command, the `apt-get` tool searches the local database for information about the `w3m` software, and based on this information, `apt-get` will download software on the relevant server. There is a question though: since the software is installed online, why it searches in local database? In order to explain this, you need to know a few terms first:

- **Software source mirror server** 
- **Software source** 

We need to download a package list periodically using the sudo `apt-get update` to keep the local package list up-to-date (and sometimes you need to do this manually, i.e when you just replace the software source). The package list contains software-dependent information for software dependencies. For example: we installed `w3m`, and this software requires `libgc1c2` to work properly. `apt-get` will install both `w3m` and `libgclc2` to ensure that `w3m` can work.

### 2.3 apt-get

We can use `apt-get` to install, uninstall and upgrade packages online. Here are some of the commonly used tools for `apt-get`:

| Tool           | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `install`      | Followed by the package name. It's used to install a package |
| `update`       | Download/update the list of packages for the local software source from the software source mirror server |
| `upgrade`      | Upgrade all locally updated packages. But no upgrades will be activated when there is dependency issues. |
| `dist-upgrade` | Solve dependency problems and upgrade softwares (there is a certain risk) |
| `remove`       | Remove installed packages, including packages that depend on the removed ones, but do not include the package's configuration files |
| `autoremove`   | Remove packages that were previously dependent on other packages but are no longer being used |
| `purge`        | Same as remove. But it will completely remove a package including its configuration files |
| `clean`        | Remove installed packages which are saved in /var/cache/apt/archives/ by default. |
| `autoclean`    | Remove the old version of installed software packages        |


Here are some common parameters for `apt-get`:

| Parameter            | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-y`                 | Automatically respond to whether to install the package. It would be useful to use this parameter in some automated installation scripts |
| `-s`                 | Simulated installation                                       |
| `-q`                 | Silent installation, specify multiple q or -q = num, used to set the silence level. This is useful when you do not want to have too much screen output when installing a package |
| `-f`                 | Fix damaged dependencies                                     |
| `-d`                 | Only download package and do not install it                  |
| `--reinstall`        | Reinstall the packages that have been installed but may have problems |
| `--install-suggests` | Install the packages recommended by APT                      |

### 2.4 Install & Re-install

As shown in the previous example, you only need to execute `apt-get install <package name>`. In addition to this, you should also know how to re-install the package.

In many cases, we need to re-install a package, such as when your system is destroyed, or some configuration mishaps lead to the software malfunction.

You can re-install as follows:

```
$ sudo apt-get --reinstall install w3m
```

Another thing you need to know is how to install the package without knowing its full name. Usually we are using the Tab key to complete the package name, followed by a better way to search for packages. Sometimes you need to install multiple packages at the same time, and you can also use the regular expression to match the package names for bulk installation.
```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'install' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "install" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.5 Update & Upgrade

```
# Update the software source
$ sudo apt-get update
# Upgrade the package that does not have dependency problems
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
# Upgrade and resolve dependencies
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```
```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'update|upgrade' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "update/upgrade" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.6 Remove

If you now feel this software `w3m` does not match your appetite, then you need to uninstall it. After using the command `sudo apt-get remove w3m`, the software will be "dumped".

![image desc3](https://labex.io/upload/A/R/H/4wKWPEEJ5kbK.jpeg)

Or you can do this:

```
# Remove the software and the configuration files
$ sudo apt-get purge w3m
# or sudo apt-get --purge remove
# Remove dependent packages that are no longer needed
$ sudo apt-get autoremove
```
```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'remove|purge' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "remove/purge" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.7 Search for softwares

When we want to download a software, the first thing we need to do is confirm whether the software is in the software warehouse or not. The order is as follows:

```
sudo apt-cache search softname1 softname2 softname3⋯⋯
```

`apt-cache` is a tool for manipulating local packages. `search` is used to find information about softname1 softname2 ... in the local database. Now we try to search before we install w3m, as shown in Figure:

![image desc4](https://labex.io/upload/K/C/C/AJcnMfKphgIv.jpeg)

The result shows four `w3m` related softwares with brief introductions of them.

To learn more about APT, refer to:

- [APT HowTo](http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/index.zh-cn.html#contents)

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'search' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "search" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
## 3. How to Use `dpkg`

Use `dpkg` to install the `deb` package from the local disk.

### 3.1 Introduction to `dpkg`

> "dpkg" is the abbreviation for "Debian Package". It is the foundation of the Debian package manager, which was created by Ian Murdoch in 1993. dpkg is very similar to RPM and is also used to install, uninstall, and supply relevant information to .deb packages.

> dpkg itself is an underlying tool. Tools mentioned above, such as APT, are used to get packages from a remote location and handle complex package relationships.

We often see `deb` packages on the Internet. You can use `dpkg` to install.

`dpkg` commonly used parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-i`      | Install the deb package                                      |
| `-R`      | Followed by the directory name; it's used to install all the deb installation package |
| `-r`      | remove an installed package                                  |
| `-I`      | Display information about an `deb` package                   |
| `-s`      | Display information about an installed software              |
| `-S`      | Search for installed packages                                |
| `-L`      | Display the directory information for the installed packages |

### 3.2 Install the `deb` package with `dpkg`

First of all, we use `apt-get -d` to download a software and not install it. After downloading emacs editor deb package, we can view the content in `/var/cache/apt/archives/`:

![image desc5](https://labex.io/upload/F/D/B/82vI0lpbmAuu.jpeg)

Then we copy the deb file to the home directory and use `dpkg` to install it:

```
$ cp /var/cache/apt/archives/emacs24_24.3+1-2ubuntu1_amd64.deb ~
# See the information about deb package before installing
$ sudo dpkg -I emacs24_24.3+1-2ubuntu1_amd64.deb
```

This package also relies on some additional packages, which means that if the current host does not have these dependent packages, the direct use of `dpkg` may encounter some problems, because dpkg cannot solve dependencies for you.

```
# Use dpkg to install
$ sudo dpkg -i emacs24_24.3+1-2ubuntu1_amd64.deb
```

As expected, some errors occur:

![image desc6](https://labex.io/upload/Q/F/L/dULhHwwxVSK6.jpeg)

We will use  `-f` parameter to fix the dependency problem:

```
$ sudo apt-get -f install
```

Installed successfully, and then you can run emacs program:

![image desc7](https://labex.io/upload/B/W/P/KmbpI49vXB0a.jpeg)

### 3.3 View the directory for installed packages

Use `dpkg -L` to view the deb package directory information:

```
$ sudo dpkg -L emacs
```

![image desc8](https://labex.io/upload/A/D/J/DwD3cDqddDHy.jpeg)

There are some other parameters of dpkg that will be learned on your own.

## 4. Install Software from Binary Package

Binary package installation is relatively simple. Download the binary package from the network and unpacked it into the directory, then add the directory which includes the executable main program file to the `PATH` environment variable.

## 5. Have fun!

This is the last section of this lab. Here we introduce a very interesting command.

Install：
```
$ sudo apt-get install bb
```

Run:
```
$ bb
```
