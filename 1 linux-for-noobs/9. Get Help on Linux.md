# Getting Help on Linux

## 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Content

We often use Linux commands, but there are some complicated commands and some less commonly used commands which are difficult to remember. This lab will teach you how to use help tools and documentation.

#### 1.2 Key Points

- Built-in commands and external commands
- `help`, `man`, `info`

## 2. Built-in Commands and External Commands

First of all, we need to understand what a built-in command is and what an external command is. 

> **Built-in commands** are actually part of the shell program, which contains some Linux system commands. These commands are written in the built-ins of the bash source and are recognized by the shell program and run in the shell program itself. When Linux system is loaded, the shell is loaded as well and saved in the memory. What's more, when parsing the built-in commands, shell does not need to create child processes, so it executes faster than external commands. 

> **External commands** are more practical programs in Linux. Since the functions of these programs are usually strong, these contain a large amount of code. When the system is loaded, the external commands are not loaded into memory. When an external command is required, the system loads it into memory. External commands are installed outside Bash, usually placed in `/bin`, `/usr/bin`, `/sbin` and `/usr/sbin`.

Briefly speaking, built-in commands are innate abilities and external commands are acquired from outside. We can use the `type` command to determine if the command is built-in or external. For example, the results of these two command executions are different:

```
type exit

type service
```

If you look at `ls`, you can get a third result:

```
# This command is a built-in command
xxx is a shell built-in
# The command is an external command
xxx is /usr/sbin/xxx
# The command is an alias for a command
xxx is an alias for xx --xxx
```

## 3. Three Help Commands
- `help`
- `man`
- `info`
### 3.1 `help`

The experimental environment is `zsh`. Unfortunately, `zsh` does not have `help` . But we can enter `bash` (another shell) to use it.

```
bash
```

![image desc2](https://labex.io/upload/L/N/E/qzUfkKokwBJY.jpeg)

We can try this command:


```
help ls
```

The results are shown as below. How could this happen?

Since the `help` command is only applicable to shell built-in commands, a brief description of the command and the description of some parameters are displayed in the help message, as well as the use of these parameters. Obviously, `ls` is not a built-in command.

In fact, almost all external commands have a parameter `--help` so that you can get the help on external commands. Try the following command:

```
ls --help
```

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'help' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "help" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 3.2 `man`

You can try this command:

```
man ls
```

![image desc5](https://labex.io/upload/E/H/I/05pDKeJ7eW0I.jpeg)

`man` can get more information than `help`. Moreover, `man` applies to all commands (built-in commands and external commands). Since `man` is to display the contents of the system manual pages, which constitute an electronic version of the dictionary, most of these contents are the interpretations of the command information.

Upon trying the command, we find that the top left corner shows **LS (1)**. **LS** indicates the name of the manual and **(1)** indicates that the manual is in the first chapter. What is this section or chapter? There are so many chapters in the `man` manualï¼š

| Chapter Number | Description             |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| `1`            | Standard commands       |
| `2`            | System calls            |
| `3`            | Library functions       |
| `4`            | Special devices         |
| `5`            | File formats            |
| `6`            | Games and toys          |
| `7`            | Miscellaneous           |
| `8`            | Administrative commands |
| `9`            | Others                  |

After opening the manual, we can use `pgup` and `pgdn` keys, or `up` and `down` keys to look up and down by scrolling. And, you can press `q` to exit the manual page.

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'man' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "man" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 3.3 `info`

If you think the `man` command is not effective enough, try the command below:

```
info ls
# this command is not shown in our environment, but bash has it.
```
![ls](https://labex.io/upload/T/S/I/crLJx0tIykr4.png)

`info` is a GNU project from the Free Software Foundation. It can have a more complete display of GNU information. So you can get more information about commands.

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'info' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "info" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
## 4. Summary

In this lab, we explained the differences between built-in commands and external commands, as well as the use of three help commands. With the use of these three help commands, we can greatly improve our work efficiency.

## 5. Homework

Try the help commands to get help for `find` and `zip`.
