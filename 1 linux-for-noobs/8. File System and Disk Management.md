# File System and Disk Management

## 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Content 

In this section, we will only cover a few commands, and the contents of file system operations are self-explanatory. 

> Since this is an introductory course and its purpose is to let you get started as soon as possible, it does not involve extensive theoretical content. Since we use an online live environment, we avoid lecturing all the time. Once you master all fundamental concepts, you can advance your learning path further on your own. Believe in yourself.

#### 1.2 Key Points

- `df`，`du`，`mount`
- Disk-related knowledge

## 2. Some Basic Commands
- Using `df` to view the capacity of the disk
- Using `du` to view the contents of a directory
### 2.1 Using `df` to View the Capacity of the Disk

```
$ df
```

You can see the following output:

![image desc1](https://labex.io/upload/S/B/S/BUAZBsm50Ylk.jpeg)


In general, we are only concerned about the contents of the first line, which is `rootfs` on virtual environment or `/dev/sda2` on real host.

>"rootfs" (Root File System) is a particular instance of Ramfs (Ramfs is a very simple Linux file system used to implement a disk cache mechanism as a dynamically resizable file system) or tmpfs (a temporary file system). Normally, the host will replace it with the file system on the disk after the system starts. But some embedded systems will only have rootfs, or the virtual environments to share the host resources may also use rootfs.

`/dev/sda2` corresponds to the disk partition. The last number in `/dev/sda2` represents the partition number. If you have multiple hard disks on your computer, the letter "a" represents that it's the first hard disk. You can also find `/dev/sdb`, `/dev/sdc`in `/dev`.

Then we add a parameter to show the capacity of the disk in a clearer way (h = human readable):

```
$ df -h
```

Now you can use the command to view the information of your hard disks. 

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'df' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "df" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.2 Using `du` to View the Contents of a Directory

Use blocks to show the size of a directory:
```
$ du 
```
Add the `-h` parameter to show the output in a more readable way:
```
$ du -h
```

The `-d` parameter specifies the depth of directories.

View only level 1 directories information:
```
$ du -h -d 0 ~
```
View level 2 directories information:
```
$ du -h -d 1 ~
```

Other parameters:
```
du -h #--human-readable Using K, M, G as a unit to improve the readability of information.
du -a #--all Displaying the size of all the files in the directory.
du -s #--summarize Only showing the total value.
```

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'du' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "du" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
## 3. Disk Management

**The following commands may cause you to lose personal data. We recommend you to operate in some virtual environment.**

First of all, we will create a virtual disk.

### 3.1 Creating a Virtual Disk

#### Some instructions of `dd` come from [dd (Unix) wiki](http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_(Unix)).

The `dd` command is used to convert and copy files, and is different from `cp`. The command `dd` can read and write all files on Linux, including special device files, such as `/dev/zero` and `/dev/random`. In this way, `dd` can also be used to backup hardware boot sector. The `dd` command can also process data when copying, such as converting byte order or interchanging between ASCII and EBCDIC codes.

The command `dd` is different from other Linux commands because its command-line option format is _option=value_, not like _-option value_ or _-option=value_. By default, `dd` is read from standard input and written to standard output. You can change that with options `if` (input file) and `of` (output file).

Firstly, we try to use `dd` to read user input from the standard input to the standard output OR to a file:

Send output to a file:
```
$ dd of=test bs=10 count=1 # or dd if=/dev/stdin of=test bs=10 count=1
```
Send output to stdout (standard output stream):
```
$ dd if=/dev/stdin of=/dev/stdout bs=10 count=1
```
After you finish this command, continue typing at the terminal as your input:


![image desc5](https://labex.io/upload/F/S/E/7wlwbuAv4Lhq.jpeg)

The above commands read user input from the standard input device and output it to the test file. The option `bs` (block size) is used to specify the block size. (Its default unit is byte. You can also specify it using 'K', 'M' or 'G'.) The option `count` is used for specified number of blocks. As shown in the above figure, we specify to read only 10 bytes of data. We enter `hello labex!` as input data. However, there are 12 bytes in total. Obviously it exceeds the set size 10. We can see the actual contents of the written file is only 10 bytes using `du` and `cat`. Other redundant input (2 bytes) will be intercepted.

As mentioned before, `dd` can also achieve data conversion. For example: we can convert English characters into uppercase and then write to the file:

```
$ dd if=/dev/stdin of=test bs=10 count=1 conv=ucase
```

![image desc6](https://labex.io/upload/Q/X/W/eSEq0y2yWPSe.jpeg)

You can view other conversion parameters in `man`.

#### Using `dd` to create a virtual image file

Create an empty file with a capacity of 256M from `/dev/zero` :

```
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=virtual.img bs=1M count=256
$ du -h virtual.img
```

![image desc7](https://labex.io/upload/J/P/F/v2WoLi1ts3LX.jpeg)

In order to format this file, we need a few commands.

#### Using the `mkfs` Command to Format the Disk

After entering `sudo mkfs`, press `Tab` to see some commands that use the prefix `mkfs`. These commands have different suffixes, corresponding to different file system types.

We can use the following command to format our virtual disk image as an ext4 file system:

```
$ sudo mkfs.ext4 virtual.img
```

[ext4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4)

#### Using `mount` Command to Mount the Disk to the Directory Tree

Before a user opens a file on a Linux/UNIX machine, the file system that contains the file must be mounted. At this point, the user needs to mount the file system using `mount` command. This command is usually used on USB or other portable storage devices. The root directory of the device always needs to be mounted, because the Linux/UNIX file system can correspond to a file. You can mount a file containing the file system to the directory tree.

The `mount` command can tell the operating system that the file system is ready, and this file system will correspond to a specific point (called a _mount point_). Then mounted files, directories, devices and special files can be used by users and processes.

We first use `mount` to view the mounted file systems:

```
$ sudo mount
```

![image desc9](https://labex.io/upload/Y/A/U/TZedR1DuWiQ8.jpeg)

Each row in the output represents a device (physical or virtual). The first word in every line is a device name. The word behind `on` depicts the mount point of this device, and the word behind `type` shows the type of file system of the respective device.

The general format of `mount` is as follows:

```
mount [options] [source] [directory]
```

Commonly used options:

```
mount [-o [options]] [-t external type] [-w|--rw|--ro] [File system source] [mount point]
```

We will now mount the virtual disk we created to`/mnt`:

```
$ sudo mount -o loop -t ext4 virtual.img /mnt 
# You can also omit the mount type

$ sudo mount -o loop --ro virtual.img /mnt
# Mounted in read-only mode
```

#### Using `umount` to Unmount a Mounted Disk
**Command Format: **`sudo umount device_name` or `sudo umount mount_point`, such as:
```
$ sudo umount /mnt
```

Unfortunately, because of our environmental issues (the Linux kernel used in our environment does not support loop devices), you will not be able to mount successfully:

![image desc10](https://labex.io/upload/J/N/W/dpzEiHo0Z6uN.jpeg)

You may have a lot of questions about 'loop device'. See the following description at [/dev/loop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/loop)：

> On UNIX-like systems,  /dev/loop, vnd (vnode disk) or lofi (loop file interface) is a pseudo-device that makes a file accessible as a block device.
>
> Before using, the looping device must be associated with a file on the existing file system. This association will provide the user with an application interface which will allow the file to be treated as a block special file (Device File System). Therefore, if the file contains a complete file system, then this file is generally mounted.
>
> This device file is often used for disc/disk mirroring. By backing up the file that contains the file system, the files in the file system can be accessed. These files will show in the mount point directory. If the contents of the mount directory itself are files, these files will be disabled when the loop device is mounted.

#### Using `fdisk` to Partition the Disk

Because the virtual environment does not have physical disks and we cannot create a virtual disk, you cannot try `fdisk` in our virtual environment. Next, I will take my physical host as an example to explain how to partition the disk.

View the information about hard disk partition:
```
$ sudo fdisk -l
```
![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/D/E/B/olI74Eu4z4t7.png)

The beginning of the output shows some information about the disks on my host, including the number of capacity sectors, sector size, I/O size and so on.

Then we focus on the middle of the output information.  `/dev/sda1` and `/dev/sda2` are primary partitions, with Windows and Linux installed respectively. `/dev/sda3`  is for the swap partition (think of that as virtual memory). `/dev/sda4`  is for the extended partition, which contains `/dev/sda5`, `/dev/sda6`, `/dev/sda7`, `/dev/sda8` logical partitions. Since there is a gap between the partitions on the host, the partitions are not contiguous. 

```
# change to the disk partition mode
$ sudo fdisk virtual.img
```
![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/Y/I/R/9t5tQN2KMkok.png)

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/B/Q/I/8i2KCHfvWP1P.png)

At the beginning, we need to plan disk partitioning scheme. I will use a 128M virtual disk to create a 30M primary partition. The remainder is an extended partition, which contains two logical partitions each about 45M in size.

Enter `p` to see the following:

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/O/H/V/lOgQ89a2sXYo.png)


Finally, do not forget to enter `w` to write to the partition table.

#### Using `losetup` to Establish an Association between the Loopback Device and the Image File

For the same reason, you can't use `losetup` in the virtual environment. I will take my physical host as an example.

```
$ sudo losetup /dev/loop0 virtual.img

$ sudo losetup -d /dev/loop0
```


And then we use `mkfs` to format the partitions. However, before formatting, we have to create a virtual device for the partition mapping. For this, you need to install `kpartx` first:

```
$ sudo apt-get install kpartx
$ sudo kpartx -av /dev/loop0

$ sudo kpartx -dv /dev/loop0
```


Then we format all of it as ext4 type:

```
$ sudo mkfs.ext4 -q /dev/mapper/loop0p1
$ sudo mkfs.ext4 -q /dev/mapper/loop0p5
$ sudo mkfs.ext4 -q /dev/mapper/loop0p6
```

Then create three empty directories in `/media` to mount the virtual disk partitions:

```
$ mkdir -p /media/virtualdisk_{1..3}
```

```
# Mount the disk partition
$ sudo mount /dev/mapper/loop0p1 /media/virtualdisk_1
$ sudo mount /dev/mapper/loop0p5 /media/virtualdisk_2
$ sudo mount /dev/mapper/loop0p6 /media/virtualdisk_3

# Unload the disk partition
$ sudo umount /dev/mapper/loop0p1
$ sudo umount /dev/mapper/loop0p5
$ sudo umount /dev/mapper/loop0p6
```

Finally：

```
$ df -h
```


## 4. Time for Fun

The `cowsay` command allows you to print out a word in a form of an animal speaking.

```
# install cowsay
$ sudo apt-get install cowsay

$ cowsay hello LabEx

# Using parameter '-l' to print out all supported animals.
$ cowsay -l

# Use the '-f' parameter to select the animal species
$ cowsay -f elephant hello LabEx

# In addition, it can also be used in conjunction with the fortune command we talked about before.
$ fortune | cowsay -f daemon
```
