## 2. History of Linux

Linux is an operating system, just like Windows (Win 10, 8, 7) and Mac OS. 

Operating systems began in the 1950s when an OS was able to run batch processes. The batch program does not require interactions with users. It reads data from a file or punch card and then outputs it to another file or printer.

In the early 1960s, interactive operating systems became popular. An interactive operating system can not only interact, but also allow multiple users from different terminals to operate the host simultaneously. This kind of operating system is called a time-sharing operating system, and its emergence was a great challenge to the batch operating system. Many people tried to develop time-sharing operating systems, including both university research projects and business projects. At that time, a project called Multics was very innovative. However, the development of the Multics project was not going well. It cost far more than expected and did not occupy much of the market share of operating systems. When Bell Labs, part of the development group, withdrew from the project, its members developed an operating system - UNIX - by themselves.

UNIX was originally released for free and was popular in their college. Later, UNIX implemented the TCP/IP protocol stack, which became the first choice for early workstation operating systems.

In 1990, UNIX became the mainstream operating system in the server market. Most campuses had UNIX hosts. Unfortunately, since then UNIX became commercialized and became very expensive. The only substitute for UNIX was MINIX, which was an operating system with similar features and was not expensive. 

In October 1991, Linus Torvalds (the father of Linux) used UNIX at the University of Helsinki. He wanted to run a similar operating system on his own computer, but the commercial version of UNIX was very expensive, so he started with MINIX which was free. He aimed to develop an operating system better than MINIX. The first release version of his operation system quickly attracted some hackers. It was named Linux. The first version of Linux was quite simple. However, as a lot of hackers tried to improve it, Linux gradually acquired many attractive features.

Linux is just a kernel of the operating system, which is the basis for other programs to run. It implements multi-tasking and hardware management. When the users or system administrators run programs, those programs are actually running on top of the kernel. Some of these programs are required, for example, the command-line interpreter (shell), which is used for interaction among users and writing shell scripts. These applications are not developed as part of Linux itself. Instead existing free applications are shipped along with Linux for installation. This reduces the amount of effort required to build a development environment. In fact, Linus Torvalds often rewrote the kernel, making it easier for those programs to run on Linux. Many important software packages, including the C compiler, came from the GNU project of the Free Software Foundation. The GNU project began in 1984 with the aim of developing a completely free UNIX-like operating system. In recognition of GNU's contribution to Linux, many people call Linux a GNU/Linux system (GNU has its own kernel Hurd).

1992-1993, the Linux kernel had all the essential features of UNIX, including TCP/IP network and graphical interface system (X Window), hence Linux also attracted the attention of many industries. Some small companies began to develop and distribute Linux, with dozens of Linux user communities established. In 1994, Linux magazine began to be issued.

Some of the breaking news about Linux are as follows:

- In 1965, Bell Labs, MIT, GE (General Electric) prepared to develop Multics system, in order to support 300-terminal access to the host, but they failed in 1969;

  > At that time, there was no mouse, keyboard and input device, only the card machine. Therefore, if you want to test a program, you need to insert a card reader paper into the card machine. If there is an error, you have to re-test. Multics: Multiplexed Information and Computing Service;

- In 1969, Ken Thompson (the father of C language) using the assembly language developed File Server System (Unics, that is, UNIX prototype);

  > Because of the dependency on hardware, assembly language can only target specific hardware;
  >
  > Just for transplanting a "space travel" game;

- In 1973, Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson invented the C language, and then wrote the UNIX kernel;

  > The B language was rewritten into C language; 90% of the code was written in C language and 10% of the code was written in assembly language, so when transplanting modifying only the 10% would suffice; 

- In 1977, Bill Joy of Berkeley University modified the UNIX source code for his machine, called BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution);

  > Bill Joy is the founder of Sun Microsystems；

- In 1979, UNIX released System V for personal computers;

- In 1984, because of the UNIX regulations, students could not be provided with source code. Therefore, for the purpose of teaching, Tanenbaum wrote their own Minix, compatible with UNIX;

- In 1984, Richard Stallman started the GNU (GNU's Not Unix) project and founded the FSF (Free Software Foundation);

- In 1985, in order to protect free software produced by GNU from being patented by others, GPL (General Public License) was created;

- In 1988, in order to develop GUI, MIT set up an organization to develop XFree86;

- In 1991, Linus Torvalds, a graduate student at the University of Helsinki, Finland, developed a Linux kernel for 386 machines based on gcc and bash;

- In 1994, Torvalds released Linux-v1.0;

- In 1996, Torvalds released Linux-v2.0, and determined the Linux mascot: penguin.

## 4. Desktop Environment
- Introduction to Linux Desktop Environment
- The Use of Linux Desktop Environment
### 4.1 Introduction to Linux Desktop Environment

Compared to the current Windows system, UNIX/Linux itself has no graphical interface. The graphical interface we usually see in the distribution of UNIX / Linux is actually running on a Linux system software. It is similar to the previous Windows graphical interface, which was actually a set of software running in the DOS environment. The graphical interface software of Linux was XFree86, now it is Xorg (X.Org).

The desktop environment is achieved through the X Window System (X Window System, also known as X11 or X). X itself is only a toolkit and architecture agreement, and Xorg is a framework of the implementation of X. Xorg is a server that provides graphical interface services, just like Apache that provides web services. However, to achieve a complete desktop environment, a client is needed, called X Client. `LabEx` is using the XFCE desktop environment. Some users probably remember that the environment used before was LXDE. That means you can choose to install a different desktop environment on a Linux system, and even customize your own desktop.


![image desc](desktop.png)


At present, we mainly talk about the concept of Linux desktop environment and the differences between Linux and Windows operating systems. In fact, there is a fundamental difference between them. We hope that you can ignore the operational differences between Windows and Linux and concentrate on the Linux system itself and the techniques you are learning in `LabEx`. This course and other courses are designed to help you achieve both of these goals.

### 4.2 The Use of Linux Desktop Environment

If you have any trouble dealing with the use of the current experimental desktop environment (XFCE), it is recommendeded that you first study the introductory course of LabEx. 

## 5. Linux Terminal


We do not operate a Linux system directly rather through a process called Shell. In the figure below, in order to achieve this in a window to complete the user input and display output, Linux system also provides a terminal emulator called the Terminal. Gnome-terminal, Kconsole, xterm, rxvt, kvt, nxterm and eterm are some of the most common terminal emulators. Now, the terminal program of our lab is the built-in `XFCE-terminal` of `XFCE` desktop environment. However, it should be noted that the terminal and the console are different.


![image desc](terminal.png)


In essence, the terminal is corresponding to the /dev/tty device on Linux. Linux multi-user function is done through /dev/tty device. Linux provides six default command-line interface "terminals" ( 6 virtual consoles) to allow users to log in. On a physical machine system, you can switch by using `[Ctrl]` + `[Alt]` + `[F1] ~ [F6]`, but may not be able to switch in our online virtual environment because the special function keys will be hijacked by your host system. When you switch to one of the terminals and want to switch back to the graphical interface, you can press `[Ctrl]` + `[Alt]` + `[F7]` to complete.

In graphical interface, the differences in user experience are not caused by the different versions of terminal emulator. Instead, Shell difference is the real reason. In addition to the shell, the system also contains UNIX/Linux kernel. Similar to the DOS command and cmd.exe, the shell is defined as the "provided user interface" software. It is a program that accepts user input commands. It is called "shell" because it hides details of the underlying operating system. In the same way, a UNIX/Linux graphical user interface, GNOME or KDE for example, is sometimes called a "virtual shell" or "graphical shell".

Shell of UNIX/Linux operating system is not only the user interaction interface but also a scripting language which can control system. This is also different from the Windows command line despite the fact that the Windows command line also provides very simple control statements. In the Windows operating system, some users will never use a shell. However, in the UNIX series operating system, the shell is a script interpreter which can control system boot, X11 boot and many other utilities.

In UNIX/Linux, some popular shells are Bash (sh), zsh, ksh, csh etc. Ubuntu terminal's default shell is Bash and the default desktop environment is GNOME or Unity (based on GNOME), but our environment uses zsh and xfce.

## 6. Input, Output and Error

In Linux, the most important thing is a command, which contains three streams (data channels): input, output and error.

In the figure, double-click the `Xfce Terminal` icon on the desktop to open the terminal, and then the system will automatically run the shell program. Finally, we can enter a command to let the system run it:


![image desc](cmd.png)


### 6.1 Input

Open the Xfce terminal, enter the command after `$` and then press Enter.

```
#Create an empty file called "file", touch is a command
$ touch file 

#Change the current directory, cd is a command
$ cd /etc/

#Print the current directory
$ pwd
```

### 6.2 Output

The output will return the results you want. For example, if you want to see the contents of a file, it will return the contents of the file. When you fail, you can see where it goes wrong. For most of the commands, if successful, there will be no output, because Linux's philosophy is: No result is the best result.

### 6.3 Error

The error stream works similar to the output stream. The underlying difference is that the error stream of a command is used when the command does not finish a successful execution. For a command, if successful, there will be no error messages.

## 7. Shortcuts

Before you learn the command line, you must master or at least be familiar with a few very useful tips:

### 7.1 [Tab]


Use the `Tab` key to make up the command. When you forget the full name of a command, you can only enter the beginning of its name or alias. Pressing the `Tab` key can help you complete the command name:

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/G/L/A/LgIYkxwB1cmB.gif)



Of course, not only making up the command, but also making up the directory names and the command parameters is feasible:

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/D/V/P/9DPBip3eA1KT.gif)


### 7.2 [Ctrl + c]

If the cursor on the screen is flashing but cannot continue to enter the command, or constantly produces a lot of outputs you do not want, how do we solve this issue? Or if you want to immediately stop and restore to your controllable state, then what shall we do? At this time, you can use `Ctrl + c` to force terminating the current program. (It will not make the terminal exit.)

Try entering the following command：

```
$ tail
```

Then you will find that your next input won't have any reaction. Now you can use `Ctrl + c` to interrupt the program. You might not know what the command is now, but in the follow-up lesson we will explain exactly what the `tail` command is.

Input the following command：

```
$ find /
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/T/G/D/g466X5w4rQrn.gif)


Obviously, this is not the result you want, you can use `Ctrl + c` to end it.

While this is very convenient, do not use `Ctrl + c` in every situation because sometimes, when you see the terminal not responding, then probably the program might be taking some time to start or finish. Therefore, in this case, do not rush to press `Ctrl + c`.

### 7.3 Some Other Shortcuts

| Shortcut Key      | Function                                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Ctrl + d`        | Keyboard input ends or exits the terminal                    |
| `Ctrl + s`        | Pause the current program and press any key to resume it     |
| `Ctrl + z`        | Put the current program into the background                  |
| `Ctrl + a`        | Move the cursor to the beginning of the input line, equivalent to `Home` |
| `Ctrl + e`        | Move the cursor to the end of the input line, equivalent to `End` |
| `Ctrl + k`        | Remove content from the the place the cursor is currently at to the end of the line |
| `Alt + Backspace` | Delete a word forward                                        |
| `Shift + PgUp`    | Scroll up the terminal                                       |
| `Shift + PgDn`    | Scroll down the terminal                                     |

### 7.4 Restore the Commands Used Before

You can use the up arrow key (`↑`) to restore the commands you used before.

## 8. Wildcards


A wildcard is a special expression. Use * and ? to match a string (such as file name or parameter name). When you search for a folder with `find` command, you can use it instead of one or more real characters. When you do not know the real characters, try to use wildcards instead of one or more actual characters.

The wildcard input in the terminal is handled by the shell, not by the program involved. It will only appear in the parameter value of command (it cannot appear in the command name). When the shell discovers a wildcard in the "parameter value", the shell searches for possible matches on the disk as a path or file name: If the match exists, it is replaced (path extension); otherwise the wildcard is passed as an ordinary character to the command and then processed by the command. In short, the wildcard is actually a kind of shell implementation of the path extension function. After the wildcard has been processed, the shell completes the reorganization of the command and then continues processing the reorganized command until the command is executed.

First, use command `touch` to create two files:

```
$ touch adsfasd.txt wergjlkas.txt
```

Name the files any way you like. If you forget the file names, and you want to find them, use wildcards：

```
$ ls *.txt
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/H/A/O/pBZsa1BAC612.jpeg)


When you are creating files, if you need to create multiple files at once, for example：**“love\_1\_linux.txt，love\_2\_linux.txt，... love\_10\_linux.txt”**, you can use the following command：

```
$ touch love_{1..10}_linux.txt
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/N/I/X/4YdmxwatYJjh.jpeg)


Common wildcards in shell：

| character               | meaning                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `*`                     | Match any zero or more characters                            |
| `?`                     | Match any single character                                   |
| `[list]`                | Match any single character of the list                       |
| `[!list]`               | Match characters other than any single character of list     |
| `[c1-c2]`               | Match any single character in the range c1 to c2 such as [0-9], [a-z] |
| `{string1,string2,...}` | Match string1 or string2 (or more) with a string             |
| `{c1..c2}`              | Match all characters or numbers in  the range c1 to c2 such as {1..10} |

## 9. Get Help

In Linux, if you encounter difficulties, you can use the `man` command which is the abbreviation of Manual pages.

Manual pages are a popular form of online software documentation for UNIX or UNIX-like operating systems, including computer programs (along with libraries and system calls), formal standards and conventions, and even abstract concepts. The user can invoke the `man` pages by executing the man command.

You can get a description of a command in the following way:

```
$ man <command_name>
```

For example, if you want to see how the `man` command is used, you can type:

```
$ man man
```

The manual script contains a lot of content, involving all aspects of Linux. In order to facilitate the search, the man manual is divided into eight sections:

| Section | Description                                         |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | General order                                       |
| 2       | System call                                         |
| 3       | Library functions, covering the C standard library  |
| 4       | Special files (usually devices in /dev) and drivers |
| 5       | File format and convention                          |
| 6       | Games and screensavers                              |
| 7       | Others                                              |
| 8       | System management commands and daemons              |

To view the contents of a particular section, simply add the number of corresponding section after the man:

```
$ man 1 ls
```

All man pages follow a rule that is optimized for simple ASCII text presentations, and this does not have any form of highlighting or font control. Generally, they include the following:

**NAME**

> The name of the command or function.

**SYNOPSIS**

> For the command, the formal description of how it works and what kind of command-line parameters it accepts. For functions, it introduces the parameters required for the function and what header file contains the definition of the function.

**DESCRIPTION**

> A description of the function or the command.

**EXAMPLES**

> Some examples of usage.

**SEE ALSO**

> A list of related commands or functions.

There may also be other parts of the content. Common examples include: OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, ENVIRONMENT, BUGS, FILES, AUTHOR, REPORTING BUGS, HISTORY and COPYRIGHT.

The man manual contains a lot of information. So your results might not be easily found. Fortunately, you can use 'search' in the man by typing in `/< keywords you want to search for> `. After the search, you can use `n` to switch to where the next occurrence of the keyword is. You can use `shift + n` to locate where the previous occurrence of the keyword is. Use the `Space` to scroll one screen down and press `Enter` to scroll one line down.

If you want more help, you can also use the `info` command. But most of the time, man is enough. If you know the function of a command and you want to see some of its specific parameters, you can use --help parameter. Most of the commands will have this parameter, such as:

```
$ ls --help
```


## 10. Homework


This Lab introduces an interesting Linux command. In this section, we introduce `banner` that can output graphic characters. Look at the effect:

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/P/F/H/0iA5wK15W3jm.jpeg)

You can use the following commands to install:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install sysvbanner
```

Then：

```
$ banner labex
```

If you think this font does not look cool, you can use an already installed command `printerbanner`：

```
$ printerbanner -w 50 A
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/T/E/F/twopszRGgP7r.jpeg)


The parameter `-w` specifies the print width. It must be added to the width limit because our environment displayed on the screen is relatively small. 

Two similar commands `toilet` and `figlet` are your homework.
