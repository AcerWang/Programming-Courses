## Introduction

There is a very important document (sources.list) in your computer, but you don't remember its location. The only thing you vaguely remember is that it's in the `/etc/` directory. Now you want to find this file, and set access authority so that you're the only authorized user to access this file.

## Tasks

1. Find the file (sources.list).
2. Change the file owner to yourself (`labex` user).
3. Set access authority so that only you can write/read this file.
