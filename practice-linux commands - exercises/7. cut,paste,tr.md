### 2.1 cut Command

The cut command is a gadget that splits the text by columns, and it can specify the delimiter that separates each column.

If a row of data contains more than one field (multiple columns) and you now want to extract one or more of them, this is the cut command.

**(1) Command Format**

> cut [option](file name)

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter    | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -b           | Split in bytes                                               |
| -c           | Split by character                                           |
| -d           | Custom separator, defaults to tabs                           |
| -f           | Custom fields                                                |
| --complement | Extract entire text lines except those specified by the -c or -f options |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** To remove the first and third columns in the student.txt file, use the following command:

```
cut -f 1,3 -d ' ' student.txt
```

**Example 2:** To remove the first column in the student.txt file, use the following command:

```
cut -f 1 -d ' ' student.txt
```

**Example 3:** To remove the first three columns in the student.txt file, use the following command:

```
cut -f 1-3 -d ' ' student.txt
```

**Example 4:** Remove the other columns in the student.txt file except for the first column, you can use the following command:

```
cut -f 1 -d ' ' student.txt --complement
```

**Example 5:** Give any string str, remove its last character, you can use the following command:

```
num=$(echo -n $str | wc -c)
echo -n $str | cut -b $num
# or
echo -n $str | cut -b `echo -n $str | wc -c`
```

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'cut' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "cut" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.2 paste Command

The function of the paste command is exactly the opposite of cut. Instead of extracting text columns from the file, it adds one or more text columns to the file. It reads multiple files and then combines the fields in each file into a single text stream that is input to the standard output.

(**1) Command Format**

> paste [option](file name)

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter | Description                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| -s        | Merge each file into rows instead of lines |
| -d        | Custom separator, defaults to tabs         |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** Splicing the contents of student.txt and telphone.txt files by column, you can use the following command:

```
paste student.txt telphone.txt
```

**Example 2:** Splicing the contents of the student.txt and telphone.txt files by columns. Specify the separator as ':'. You can use the following command:

```
paste student.txt telphone.txt -d ':'
```

**Example 3:** Splicing the contents of the student.txt and telphone.txt files into a single line, you can use the following command:

```
paste -s student.txt telphone.txt
```

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'paste' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "paste" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.3 tr Command

The tr command is often used to change characters. We can think of it as a character-based search and replace operation. Word change is the process of converting characters from one letter to another. Tr Replaces, reduces, and/or deletes characters from standard input and writes the result to standard output.

Tr can only pass stdin (standard input) and cannot accept input via command line arguments.

Tr is the abbreviation for translate.

**(1) Command Format**

> Tr [options] SET1 SET2

Map input characters from stdin from SET1 to SET2 and write their output to stdout (standard output). SET1 and SET2 are character classes or character sets. If the lengths of the two character sets are not equal, then SET2 will continue to repeat its last character until it has the same length as SET1. If the length of SET2 is greater than SET1, all the characters that exceed SET1 in SET2 are ignored.

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter | Description                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| -d        | Delete content that matches SET1 and do not replace |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** To convert the input characters to lowercase, use the following command:

```
echo 'THIS IS SHIYANLOU!' | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z'
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/M/A/J/YY4v3Jv01lTf.png)

**Example 2:** To delete the numbers in the input characters, use the following command:

```
echo 'THIS 123 IS S1HIY5ANLOU!' | tr -d '0-9'
```

**Example 3:** An interesting use of the tr command is to perform ROT13 text encoding. ROT13 is a trivial type of encryption based on a simple replacement password. Calling ROT13 "encryption" is generous, and "text blurring" is more accurate. Sometimes it is used to hide potential attack content in text. This method is simply to move each character forward by 13 in the alphabet. Because the number of bits moved is half of the possible 26 characters, executing this algorithm again on the text returns to its original form. You can use the following command:

```
#encryption
echo 'shiyanlou' |  tr  'a-zA-Z'  'n-za-mN-ZA-M'
fuvlnaybh
#Decryption
echo 'fuvlnaybh' | tr  'a-zA-Z'  'n-za-mN-ZA-M'
shiyanlou
```
