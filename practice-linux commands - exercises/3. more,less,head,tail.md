### 2.1 more Command

The more command, which is similar in function to cat , is to display the contents of the entire file from top to bottom on the screen. The more command displays page by page, allowing users to read page by page. The most basic command is to press the space bar to display on the next page, and press the b button to go back to the next page. There is also a search string function. The more command reads the file from front to back, so the entire file is loaded at startup.

**(1) Command Format**

> more [option] file

**(2) Common Parameters**

### The difference between less and cat and more:

Cat command function: used to display the contents of the entire file, used alone without page turning function. Therefore, it is often used with the more command. The cat command also has the function of combining several files into one file.

More Command Function: Allows the screen to pause when a full page is displayed. Press the space bar to continue to display the next screen, or press the q button to stop the display.

The less command function: The use of the less command is similar to the more command. It can also be used to browse more than one page of files. The difference is that the less command can use the up and down keys to scroll through files, in addition to pressing the space bar to display files down. When you want to end browsing, just press q under the ":" prompt of the less command.

In fact, the three commands except the cat command have the function of merging files, the rest of the functions are similar, but they are different from the browsing habits and display methods.

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'less' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "less" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.3 head Command

The head command is as easy to understand as its name is. It is mainly used to display the beginning of the file to the standard output. The default head command prints the first 10 lines of its corresponding file.

**(1) Command Format**

> head [option](file)

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter          | Description                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |

| -v                 | Display file name            |
| -c<byte>           | Display bytes                |

Ping www.labex.com >> labex.log This command pings the remote host and appends the information to the labex.log file. The effect of & is to place this command in the background so that the labex.log file will always have more content. Note that the ping command under Linux will always be executed and must be stopped manually. When the ping command is executed under Windows, it will stop automatically after sending a certain request.

Use the -f option of the tail command to output the contents of the file immediately after the file changes. tail -f filename will display the contents of the end of filename on the screen, and not only refresh, allowing you to see the latest file content.Also by the way, how do you view the tasks that are running in the background and how to stop them?The jobs command can see the tasks that are running in the background. The kill command can kill a task but use the task's id. The id of the task can be obtained by viewing the ps command.

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'tail' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "tail" cmd.
  timeout: 3
