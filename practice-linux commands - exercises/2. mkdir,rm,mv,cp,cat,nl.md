### 2.1 mkdir Command

**(1) Command Format**

> mkdir [options] directory

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter      | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -m --mode=mode | Set permissions <mode>                                       |
| -p   --parents | It can be a path name. If some of the directories in the path do not exist yet, this option will automatically create directories that do not yet exist, that is, multiple directories can be created at one time. |
| -v   --verbose | Each time a new directory is created, information is displayed |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** Recursively create multiple directories, you can use the following command: 

```
mkdir  -p  zhou/test
```

**Example 2:** To create a directory with privilege 777, use the following command:

```
mkdir  -m 777  zhou
```

**(4) Questions**

Try the following command and see if anything magic happens

Tree needs to be installed separately

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tree
```

```
mkdir -vp shiyanlou/{lib/,bin/,doc/{info,product}}
tree shiyanlou/
```
```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'mkdir' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "mkdir" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.2 rm Command

Rm is a commonly used command. The function of this command is to delete one or more files or directories in a directory. It can also delete a directory and all files and subdirectories under it. For the link file, only the link is deleted and the original file remains unchanged.

Rm is a dangerous command. Be careful when using it. Especially for novices, the entire system will be destroyed in this command (for example, rm * -rf under / (root directory)). Therefore, before we implement rm, it is better to confirm which directory we are in, and what we want to delete.

The rm command is an abbreviation for remove.

**(1) Command Format**

> rm [options] file or directory

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter         | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -f  --force       | Ignore nonexistent files and never give prompts              |
| -i  --interactive | Make an interactive deletion                                 |
| -r  --recursive   | Instructs rm to recursively delete all directories and subdirectories listed in the parameter |
| -v  --verbose     | Detailed display of the steps performed                      |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** delete the file, the system will first ask whether to delete, you can use the following command:

```
rm  labex.txt
```

```
rm -f labex.log
```

**(4)Questions**

Consider what the following command does.

```
myrm(){ D=/tmp/$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S); mkdir -p $D; mv "$@" $D && echo "moved to $D ok"; }
```
```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'rm' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "rm" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.3 mv Command

The mv command's function is used to move files or change file names. It is a commonly used command on Linux systems and is often used to back up files or directories.

The mv command decides to either rename the file or move it to a new directory based on the second parameter type (either the target file or the target directory). When the second parameter type is a file, the mv command completes the file renaming. At this time, the source file can only have one (it can be the source directory name). It renames the given source file or directory to a given file. Target file name. When the second parameter is an existing directory name, there can be multiple source file or directory parameters. The mv command moves the source files specified by each parameter to the target directory.

The mv command is an abbreviation of move.

**(1) Command Format**

> mv [options] source file or directory  target file or directory

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter        | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -b  --back       | If you need to overwrite the file, you will need to back it up before overwriting. |
| -f  --force      | If the target file already exists, it will be directly overwritten without asking |
| -i --interactive | If the target file already exists, it will ask whether to cover |
| -u --update      | If the target file already exists and the source file is new, it will be updated |
| -t  --target     | This option is suitable for moving multiple source files to a directory. At this time, the target directory is first and the source file is later. |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** Rename the file labex.log to zhou.log. You can use the following command:

```
mv   labex.log   zhou.log
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/F/W/F/k3T1Xlfz57Tw.png)

**Example 2:** Move the file zhou.log to the test directory (the test directory must already exist, otherwise perform the rename), you can use the following command:

```
mv  zhou.log  test
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/D/E/P/Aw9M5L6G1qcW.png)

**Example 3:** Move the file a.txt to the test1 directory. If the file exists, you will be asked whether to overwrite it before overwriting. You can use the following command:

```
mv  -i  a.txt  test1
```
```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'mv' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "mv" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.4 cp Command

The cp command is used to copy files or directories and is one of the most commonly used commands on Linux systems. Under normal circumstances, the shell will set an alias. When the file is copied from the command line, if the target file already exists, it will ask whether to overwrite, whether you use the -i parameter or not. However, if you execute cp in a shell script, there is no -i parameter that will not ask for overwriting. This shows that the command line and the shell script perform differently.

The cp command is an abbreviation for copy.

**(1) Command Format**

> cp [options] source file directory
>
> cp [options] -t directory source files

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter               | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -t   --target-directory | Specify the target directory                                 |
| -i   --interactive      | Ask before overwriting (make the previous -n option invalid) |
| -n   --no-clobber       | Do not overwrite existing files (disable previous -i option) |
| -s   --symbolic-link    | Create symbolic links to source files instead of copying files |
| -f   --force            | Forcibly copy files or directories, regardless of whether the destination file or directory already exists |
| -u   --update           | After using this parameter, the file will be copied only when the modification time of the source file is more than the destination file, or the corresponding destination file does not exist. |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** To create a symbolic link to the file labex.log zhou.log, you can use the following command:

```
cp   -s   labex.log   zhou.log
```

**Example 2:** Copy all the files in the test1 directory to the test2 directory. Before overwriting, you can use the following command:

```
cp  -i  test1/*  test2
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/S/S/J/SwpohIl2jgq6.png)

**Example 3:** Copy the most recently updated file from the test1 directory to the test2 directory. Before overwriting, use the following command:

```
cp  -iu  test1/*  test2
```

    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'cp' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "cp" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.5 cat Command

The function of the cat command is to output a file or standard input combination to standard output. This command is often used to display the contents of a file, or to link several files together, or to read and display content from standard input. It is often used in conjunction with redirection symbols.

The cat command is an abbreviation for concatenate.

**(1) Command Format**

> cat [option](file)

```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/V/J/D/pSlSmg61v12y.png)

Description: tac is to overwrite cat, so its function is the opposite of cat, cat is continuously displayed on the screen from the first line to the last line, and tac is the reverse from the last line to the first line on the screen display.

**(4) Questions**

Execute the following command will output what.

    grep -i 'cat' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "cat" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.6 nl Command

The nl command is used in the linux system to calculate the line number in the file. Nl can automatically add the line number to the output file content. The default result is slightly different from cat -n. nl can display the line number more than the display design, including the number of bits and whether it automatically fills 0 and so on.

The nl command is an abbreviation for number of lines.

**(1) Command Format**

nl [option](file)

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -b        | There are two main ways to specify the line number:          |
| -b a      | Indicates that the line number is also listed whether it is a blank line or not (similar to cat -n) |
| -b t      | If there is an empty line, do not list the line number in the empty line (default) |
| -n        | There are three main ways to list line numbers:              |
| -n ln     | The line number is displayed at the far left of the screen   |
| -n rn     | The line number is displayed on the far right of its own field, without adding 0 |
| -n rz     | The line number is displayed on the far right of its own field, plus 0 |
| -w        | The number of digits occupied by the row number field        |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** After the labex.log file is added with the line number, the blank line without the line number can be used as follows:

```
nl -b t labex.log
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/T/P/B/i0kZjemcZPLv.png)

**Example 2:** After the labex.log file is added with the line number, the line number is displayed at the leftmost, rightmost, and rightmost 0 of the screen. You can use the following command:

```
nl -n ln labex.log
nl -n rn labex.log
nl -n rz labex.log
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/L/L/J/k18XlMteNS0A.png)

**Example 3:** After adding the line number to the labex.log file contents, the line number is displayed at the far right of the screen plus 0. The line number column has 3 bits. You can use the following command:

```
nl -n rz -w 3 labex.log
```
