## 2.Experiment  Procedure
- sort
- uniq
- join
### 2.1 sort Command

When dealing with text files, you can't avoid sorting. That's because sorting can play a big role in text processing tasks. The sort command helps us sort text files and stdin. Usually, it combines other commands to generate the desired output.

**(1) Command Format**

> sort [option](file name)

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -n        | Sort based on the length of the string, use this option to allow sorting based on numeric values instead of alpha values |
| -k        | Specify sort keywords                                        |
| -b        | By default, the entire row is sorted, starting with the first character of each line. This option causes the sort program to ignore spaces at the beginning of each line, sorting from the first nonwhite space character |
| -m        | Only merge multiple input files                              |
| -r        | Sort in reverse order, results are sorted in descending order, not ascending |
| -t        | Custom separator, defaults to tabs                           |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** List the top 10 directory files in the /usr/share/ directory. You can use the following command:

```
du -s /usr/share/* | sort -nr | head -10
```

The du -s /usr/share/* command displays the disk space for all files and directories in the /usr/share/ directory. The directory contains subdirectories and files under the directory.

**Example 2:** The ls command can display the detailed information of the files in the directory, including the size of the space used. However, unlike the du command, the ls command does not calculate the size of the subdirectories and files in the directory. The ls display format is as follows:

```
-rwxrwxrwx   1  root   root  542  mar 19 13:18  test.php
```

Now you want to sort the space usage size field in the output of the ls command, you can use the following command:

```
ls -l /usr/bin/ | sort -nr -k 5 | head -10
```

**Example 3:** First look at the following example:

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/E/P/Q/hicOozEXZeQD.png)

Since 11 starts with 1, it is smaller than 5, so it is ahead of 5. Sorting can now be sorted by a custom sort field. Use the following command to solve.

```
sort  -k 1,1  -k 2n data.txt
```

The first -k option indicates that only the first field is sorted, 1,1 means "starting at and ending at the first field."

The second -k option 2n indicates that the second field is sorted numerically.

There is also a format, such as -k 3.4n, which represents the fourth character from the third field, sorted numerically.

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/F/C/U/Bi2osvSFD9Bn.png)

The syntax of the -k option is as follows:

> [ FStart [ .CStart ] ][ Modifier ] [ , [ FEnd [ .CEnd ] ][ Modifier ] ]

This grammar format can be divided into two parts by the comma (","), the Start part and the End part.

First instill a thought for you, that is, "If you do not set the End part, then think End is set to the end of the line." This concept is very important, but often you will not value it.

The Start section also consists of three parts, where the Modifier section is an option section similar to n and r. We focus on the FStart and CStart in the Start section.

FStart.CStart, where FStart is the field that represents the use, and CStart represents the "first character to sort" from the first few characters in the FStart field. CStart can be omitted. If omitted, it means starting from the beginning of this field. The -k 5 in the previous example is an example that omits CStart.

Similarly, in the End section, you can set FEnd.CEnd. If you omit .CEnd, it means that the end is "end of field", which is the last character of this field. Or, if you set CEnd to 0 (zero), it also indicates the end of the field to the end of the field.

  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'sort' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "sort" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.2 uniq Command

The uniq command is often used in conjunction with the sort command. Uniq accepts an ordered list of data from standard input or a single file name parameter, and by default, removes any duplicate rows from the data list.

Uniq can only be used for sorted data input, so uniq uses either piped or sorted files as input and is always used in conjunction with the sort command in this way.

The uniq command is an abbreviation for unique .

**(1) Command Format**

> uniq [option][file name]

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -c        | Prepend each line with a prefix number indicating the number of occurrences of the corresponding line |
| -d        | Only output duplicate rows                                   |
| -u        | Only show unique rows                                        |
| -D        | Display all duplicate rows                                   |
| -f        | Skip the first n columns when comparing                      |
| -i        | Case-insensitive comparisons                                 |
| -s        | Skipping the first n characters when comparing               |
| -w        | Do not compare the contents of the nth character after each line |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** To find out all the same commands in the /bin directory and the /usr/bin directory, use the following command:

```
ls /bin /usr/bin  | sort | uniq -d
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/I/O/L/cHBBcTHhMUjl.png)

**Example 2:** The contents of the existing documents are as follows. The content in the red box indicates the area code. The total number of each area code must now be counted.

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/J/B/V/ro6qDOCxfOHj.png)

Implementation ideas: First, sort the information of each row by area code, and then use the uniq command to repeat the statistics for the area code. Use the command as follows:

```
sort -k 4.1n student.txt | uniq -c -f 3 -w 2
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/T/E/M/Um7ZQH1isf7M.png)

**Sort -k 4.1n** means to sort the first character of the fourth field numerically.

**Uniq -c -f 3 -w 2 -f 3** means to skip the comparison of the first three columns, so now only the last column is left. **-w 2** means that the contents after the second character are not compared. Why is 2? Because skipping the first three columns does not skip the space separator before the last column, there is a space before the area code.

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'uniq' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "uniq" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.3 join Command

The join command is similar to paste , which adds columns to the file, but it uses a unique approach. A join operation is usually associated with a relational database in which data from multiple tables sharing common key fields is combined to obtain a desired result. This join command does the same thing and it combines data from multiple shared key domain based files.

In layman's terms, it is to connect the two lines with the same field in the two files, that is, to splice the corresponding line into one line according to a common column in the two files.

**(1) Command Format**

> join  [option] file 1  file 2

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -j FIELD  | Equivalent to -1 FIELD -2 FIELD,-j specifies a field as a match field |
| -1 FIELD  | Match with FIELD field in file1                              |
| -2 FIELD  | Match with FIELD field in file2                              |
| -t        | Custom separator, defaults to tabs                           |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** The first field in two files as a match field, connect two files, you can use the following command:

```
join  a.txt  b.txt
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/F/T/F/lqUvQ7ndCf2T.png)

**Example 2:** Specify the third field of the two files as the match field, connect two files, you can use the following command:

```
join  -1 3 -2 3 c.txt d.txt
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/B/E/Y/ApPSxBNnBOtJ.png)

As you can see from the above results, an error occurred when executing the join command on the contents of the a.txt and b.txt files. This is because the join command, like the uniq command, can only be used for sorted data.

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'join' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "join" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
