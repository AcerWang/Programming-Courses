# Modify and Delete

## 1. Introduction

In today's lab, we will learn and practice how to modify, delete, rename the database table and the contents of the table and other operations.

### Learning Objectives

- database operations
- data table operations
- update and delete data

### Operating Environment

Lab environment used is Ubuntu Linux 14.04.64. We will also use:

- Mysql 5.5.50
- Xfce terminal

## 2. Content

###2.1 Preparation


Before we start, please download code first. 


Use the code to build 2 database `test_01` and `mysql_lab`. Create 4 tables (department, employee, project, table_1) in `mysql_lab` and insert data. 

Follow the steps below. First input command and enter into `/home/labex/Desktop` directory:

```shell
cd /home/labex/Desktop
```

Enter command to download code:

```shell
wget https://labexfile.oss-us-west-1-internal.aliyuncs.com/courses/7/MySQL-05-01.sql
```

When the download is complete, enter command, start MySQL service and log in as root:


start MySQL service
```shell
sudo service mysql start        
```

log in as root
```shell
mysql -u root
```

There is a file `MySQL-05.sql` (**Use gedit to view file inside.**)


Load data in the files. Enter the command below to MySQL and you're done with preparation phase. 
```shell
source /home/labex/Desktop/MySQL-05.sql
```

### 2.2 Modify database

Use command `SHOW DATABASES;` to see the two databases created by `MySQL-05.sql` file:

Now we delete the `test_01` database by running the command below:

```sql
DROP DATABASE test_01;
```

Run command `SHOW DATABASES` again and we'll see `test_01` database is deleted succussfully.

### 2.3 Modify a table

#### 2.3.1 Rename

There are multiple ways to rename a table. The three formats listed below have the same result:

```sql
RENAME TABLE originalname TO newname;

ALTER TABLE originalname RENAME newname;

ALTER TABLE originalname RENAME TO newname;
```

Use command to change `table_1` to`table_2` ：

#### 2.3.2 Delete a table

Similar to the statement we just used to delete database, here's how we delete a table:
```sql
DROP TABLE table name;
```

For example, let's delete `table_2`:

### 2.4 Modify a column (modify table format)

How to modify table format is the tricky part in this lab. Sometimes a tiny mistake may result in big margin of error. So please be patient and meticulous. 

#### 2.4.1 Add a column

Here's the statement format to add a column

```sql
ALTER TABLE tablename ADD COLUMN columnname datatype constraint;
    
Or： ALTER TABLE tablename ADD columnname datatype constraint;
```

We have 6 columns in the employee table: `id name age salary phone in_dpt`. Let's add a ``height` column and assign DEFAULT constraint:

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/P/Q/N/HalBt0KmNsnL.png)

We can see that the newly-added colum is placed at the very right by defualt. If we want to move it to a specified place, then at the end of the statement, we need to use AFTER keyword (**"AFTER column 1" means the new column will be placed after "column 1"**)

For exmaple we add a new column `weight` after `age`:

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/Y/G/R/rMU7wYOw58Kl.png)

You should get a result like the figure above. If we want to make it the first column, then we will use `FIRST` keyword.

```sql
ALTER TABLE employee ADD test INT(10) DEFAULT 11 FIRST;
```

Does your result look like this one below?

#### 2.4.2 Delete a column

We only need to change keyword `ADD` to `DROP`. No data type, constraint, or place info.

```sql
ALTER TABLE tablename DROP COLUMN columnname;
    
Or： ALTER TABLE tablename DROP Columnname;
```

Let's delete `test`:

#### 2.4.3 Rename a column

(CHANGE) can do more than just rename a column. To be more precise, this statement can modify a column.

```sql
ALTER TABLE tablename CHANGE oldcolumnname newcolumnname datatype constraint;
```

>**Please note：if you forget to include "data type", then rename will fail.**

When **original column name** is the same as **new column name**, assign new **data type** or **osntraint** can change its data type and constraint. Pay attention here - change data type might lead to data loss so be careful. 

Let's rename the "height" column to "shengao":

#### 2.4.4 Change data type

Other than the **CHANGE** statement we learnd earlier, we can also use the **MODIFY** statement: 

```sql
ALTER TABLE tablename MODIFY columnname newdatatype;
```

Attention: be aware of potential data loss when you modify data type. Be cautious.

### 2.5 Modify Table Content

#### 2.5.1 Modify a specific value

Most of the time, we want to change a single value or multiple values instead of the entire table or database. Then we will use the statement below:

```sql
UPDATE tablename SET column 1 = value 1, column 2=value 2 WHERE condition;
```

For example, change Tom's age to 21, his salary to 3,000: 


![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/J/H/O/rO8HWHBPviHi.png)


>**Please note：make sure you have the WHERE condition, otherwise failure occurs**

#### 2.5.2 Delete a row

Make sure WHERE condition is included when you delete a row, otherwise the entire column data will be deleted:

```sql
DELETE FROM tablename WHERE condition;
```

Try to delete Tom's data:

## 3. Summary

In this lab, we learnd how to modify and delete database, table, and specific column, row and value.

## 4. Homework

1. Follow the instructions and practice on your own: first use to code to build a database and insert data, and then try the statements mentioned in this lab. 
2. Use the UPDATE statement without WHERE condition and see what will happen (take snapshot and explain why).
