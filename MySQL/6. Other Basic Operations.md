# Other Basic Operations

## 1. Introduction

This lab we will learn and practice index, view, import, export, backup and recovery. These concepts are very crucial for a database manager.

### Learning Objectives

- Index
- View
- Import and Export
- Backup and Recovery

### Operating Environment

Lab environment used is Ubuntu Linux 14.04.64. We will also use:

- Mysql 5.5.50
- Xfce terminal 


## 2. Content

###2.1 Preparation

Before we start, please download code first. 

The code downloaed will build a batabase named `mysql_labex` (3 tables inside：department，employee，project). Insert data. 

Follow the steps below.

**(1)** Enter command to download code:

```shell
wget https://labexfile.oss-us-west-1-internal.aliyuncs.com/courses/7/Challenge02.txt
wget https://labexfile.oss-us-west-1-internal.aliyuncs.com/courses/7/Challenge02-in.txt
```


When the download is complete, enter command, start MySQL service and log in as root:

**(2)** start MySQL service
```shell
sudo service mysql start        
```
**(3)** log in as root
```shell
mysql -u root                   
```


There are two files `Challenge02.txt` and `Challenge02-in.txt`. Use the first one to build database and insert data. We will use the second file in later steps.


**(4)** Enter command and run the first file. Build database and insert data:

```shell
source /home/labex/Challenge02.txt
```

### 2.2 Index

Index is a table-related structure. Its role is equivalent to a book's directory. You can quickly find the content according to the page number in a directory.

When you want to query a table which has a large number of records, and it does not have index, then all records will be pulled out to match the search conditions one by one, and return the records that match the conditions. It is very time-consuming and results in large number of disk I/O operations.

If index exists in the table, then we can quickly find the data in the table by the index value, which greatly speeds up the query process.

There are two ways to set up index to a particular column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table name ADD INDEX index name (column name);

CREATE INDEX index name ON table name (column name);
```

Let's use these two statements to build index:

build a idx_id index in the id column in employee table
```sql
ALTER TABLE employee ADD INDEX idx_id (id);  
```
build idx_name index in the name column in employee table
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON employee (name);   
```

We use index to speed up the query process. When there is not enough data, we won't be able to feel its magic power. Here let's use command **SHOW INDEX FROM table name** to view the index that we just created. 

```sql
SHOW INDEX FROM employee;
```

When we use SELECT statement to query, the WHERE condition will automatically judge whether there exists an index.

### 2.3 View

View is a virtual table derived from one or more tables. It is like a window through which people can view special data provided by system so that they won't have to view the entire data in the database. They can focus on the ones they're interested in. 

How to interpret "View is virtual table"?

- Only the definition of View is stored in database while its data is stored in the original table;
- When we use View to query data, the database will extract data from original table correspondingly. 
- Since data in View is dependent on what's stored in original table, therefore once data in table has changed, what we see in View will change as well.
- Treat View as a table. 


Statement format used to create View:

```sql
CREATE VIEW view name (column a, column b, column c) AS SELECT column 1, column 2, column 3 FROM table name;
```

From the statement we can see that the latter part is a SELECT statement, which means View can also be **built on multiple tables**. All we need to do is use subqueries or join in SELECT statement.


Now let's create a simple View named **v_emp** which includes three columns **v_name**，**v_age**，**v_phone**:

```sql
CREATE VIEW v_emp (v_name,v_age,v_phone) AS SELECT name,age,phone FROM employee;
```
and then enter
```sql
SELECT * FROM v_emp;
```

### 2.4 Import

We can import data from a document to a table. Import statement format is: 

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'file path and name' INTO TABLE table name;
```

There is a **Challenge02-in.txt** file. Now let's try to import data in this file to **employee** table in **mysql_lab** database.

First press **Ctrl+Z** to exit MySQL. 

Open Xfce terminal and enter command to copy the two files to `/tmp` directory：

```shell
cp Challenge02-in.txt /tmp/
cp Challenge0 /tmp/
```

Then use command `gedit /tmp/Challenge02-in.txt` view contents in `Challenge02-in.txt` file：

```
6	Alex	26	3000	123456	dpt1
7	Ken	27	3500	654321	dpt1
8	Rick	24	3500	987654	dpt3
9	Joe	31	3600	100129	dpt2
10	Mike	23	3400	110110	dpt1
11	Jim	35	3000	100861	dpt4
12	Mary	21	3000	100101	dpt2
```

Use the command below to log in as root and connect to **mysql_labex** database:


Enter command in Xfce terminal
```shell
mysql -u root
```
Enter command in MySQL console
```sql
use mysql_labex
```

Here's the employee table without importing data:

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/V/H/P/4cf0ZWW1lhKu.png)

Now execute import and below is the new employee table:
```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/Challenge02-in.txt' INTO TABLE employee;
```
and then enter
```sql
SELECT * FROM employee;
```

### 2.5 Export

Export, the reverse process of import, is to export a data in database to a file. Basic format is as follows:

```sql
SELECT column 1，columnn 2 INTO OUTFILE 'file path and name' FROM table name;
```

**Note：no duplicate file names under file path**

Let's export all data in employee table to /tmp directory. Name the exported file in **out.txt**. Statement detail:

```sql
SELECT * INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/out.txt' FROM employee;
```

We can use gedit to view exported file content `/tmp/out.txt`:

```shell
gedit /tmp/out.txt
```

### 2.6 Backup

For security reason, backup is extremely important in database management.

>Difference between backup and export：exported file only saves the data in a database while backup saves the entire database structure including data, constraints, indexes, view etc. to a new file. 
>
>**mysqldump** is a practical program in MySQL for backup. It produces a SQL script file which contains all essential commands to recreate a database from scratch, such as CREATE TABLE INSERT and etc.

Statement to use mysqldump backup:

```sql
mysqldump -u root database name>backup file name;   #backup entire database

mysqldump -u root database name table name>backup file name;  #backup the entire table
```

Try backup the entire database `mysql_labex`. Name the file to `bak.sql`. First press `Ctrl+Z` to exit MySQL console, then open Xfce terminal，and enter the command:

```sql
mysqldump -u root mysql_labex > bak.sql;
```

Use command "ls" and we'll see the backup file `bak.sql`;

>You can also use gedit to see other information in the backup file.

### 2.7 Recovery

As a matter of fact, we have already practiced using backup file to recover database. Eailer in this lab, we used a command: 

```shell
source /tmp/Challenge02.txt
```

This is actually a recovery statement. It recovers `mysql_labex` database stored in  Challenge02-in.txt.

There is another way to recover database, but before that we need to create an **empty database named test** first

```sql
mysql -u root          #log in first since we logged out earlier

CREATE DATABASE test;  #create a new database named test
```
**Ctrl+Z** to exit MySQL. Recover the **bak.sql** to **test** database：

```shell
mysql -u root test < bak.sql
```

We can confirm whether the recovery is successful or not by entering command to view tables in the test database:

log in to MySQL
```shell
mysql -u root          
```
connect to database test
```sql
use test               
```
view tables in database test
```sql
SHOW TABLES;           
```

We can see that the 4 tables and 1 view in the original database have already been recovered to test database:

Now let's see the employee table: 

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee;
```

## 3. Summary

In today's lab, we have practiced the following basic concepts:

1. Index：speed up the process
2. View：a virtual table
3. Import：import data from file to table
4. Export：export data from table to file
5. Backup：mysqldump backup database to file
6. Recovery：Recover database from file

## 4. Homework

1. Follow instructions and operate on your own. Take snapshots of your procedure or your questions if needed.
2. Use Subqueries or Join, create View of multiple tables, use SELECT statement to display content in View. Take snapshot if needed.
