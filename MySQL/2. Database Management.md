# Database Management

##1. Introduction

Previously, we have covered the process of installing a MySQL server, connecting to it using a client and performing some basic administration tasks.

In this lab, we will look at managing databases. This will involve creating databases, dropping databases and selecting databases. We will also look at retrieving database metadata and importing/exporting databases.

###Learning Objective

- Concepts about database management: creating, listing, selecting and dropping databases.
- Practice operations above through various MySQL client, command line and PHP scripts.
- Export data from a database table.
- Import data into a database table.

## 2. Content

There are multiple ways that you can create a new database in MySQL. Naturally, managing databases requires special privileges. Of course, the root user will have any privileges that are required.

For this part of the tutorial, in the example, we will use the root user, however feel free to use another user with appropriate permissions.

### 2.1 Creating a Database Using the Command Line

Perhaps the most straight forward way to create a new database is to use the MySQL client directly.

In your terminal, login to MySQL as shown. Make sure you have your username and password ready (or the root authentication details if necessary). You will be prompted for a password, enter it.

```shell
$ mysql -u root -p
```

#### 2.1.1 Listing Available Databases

Before we create a database, if you would like to list the available databases on your MySQL server, you can do so using the `show databases;` command. Try it now (remember, it's 'database++s++', as in plural).

```sql
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/M/R/U/j84XNoNmbeMr.jpg)

As you can see, the command has listed all the databases available on the server.

Now, back to creating databases.

#### 2.1.2 Creating a Database Using the MySQL client.

You can use the `create database` command to accomplish this task. Try it now and then use the `show databases` command again to see the difference.

```
mysql> CREATE DATABASE Hello_World;
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/B/L/I/u5a3yps9g4hs.jpg)

As you can see, you have successfully created a new database called 'Hello_World'.

#### 2.1.3 Case-Sensitivity of Database Names

While SQL itself is a **case-insensitive** language, in MySQL, database names are **case-sensitive**, as well as table names. To demonstrate, make the following database.

```
mysql> CREATE DATABASE Hello_World;
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/C/F/B/a6J0usYXYT7Y.jpg)

As you can see, it failed because there is already a database called 'Hello_World'.

However, try to create another database as follows.

```
mysql> CREATE DATABASE hello_world;
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/L/J/L/VdA9PBg69l8I.jpg)


As you can see, we were successful, because database names are case-sensitive. 'Hello_World' and 'hello_world' are two different databases.

### 2.2 Creating a Database Using mysqladmin Binary

You can also create a database using the **mysqladmin** tool, directly from the command line. Exit MySQL using either `quit` or `exit` (you don't need to worry about the semi-colon), then run the following command. Log back into your MySQL client and view the database list.

```
$ mysqladmin -u root -p create hello_world2
$ mysql -u root -p

mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/V/X/B/dfTfKT798KuG.jpg)

As you can see, you have successfully created the 'hello_world2' database using the **mysqladmin** binary. This is probably the quickest way to make a new database if you need it.

### 2.3 Creating a Database using PHP Script

As we saw in the previous lab, you can also easily use PHP to make MySQL connections. Of course, PHP can also be used to create tables.

To do this, we will need to make a PHP script that connects to our MySQL server. Since we are doing this in linux/BaSH, we will store all our scripts in their own file from now on. Exit the command line and use the following command to create a new directory.

```
$ cd ~/Code
$ mkdir phpScripts
```

Then use the following command to change into this directory.

```
$ cd phpScripts
```

Now, in this directory, create a new PHP script file using the following command.

```
$ touch createDatabase.php
```

This will have created a new file using the command line. Now you can open this file via your file browser using your text editor of choice. In this tutorial, the text editor that will be shown is *gedit*.

In a text editor, add the following code to the empty script file. Note that at this point, the script only connects to a database (similar to what we made in the first lab). You can change the username and password as needed.

```
<?php
    $connection = @mysqli_connect('localhost', 'root', 'password');
    if(mysqli_connect_errno()) {
        echo "Could not connect to server: \n".mysqli_connect_error()."\n";
		exit();
    }
    echo "Connected successfully\n";
   
	// Create Table Code Will Go Here

	mysqli_close($connection);
?>
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/F/B/W/n2JVCKPVJ2E7.jpg)


In order to create a new database using a PHP script, PHP uses the `mysqli_query()` function (from PHP7.0 and onward). All this function does is execute a series of SQL commands that we specify. In this example, we will be adding the create database command to the `$sql` variable in our script, this is the same command that we used above.

```
CREATE DATABASE hello_world3;
```

Good! Now, in your PHP script, replace the commented line with the following.

```
$sql = "CREATE DATABASE hello_world3";
$returnValue = mysqli_query( $connection, $sql );
if (! $returnValue) {
	echo "Could not execute query:\n".mysqli_error($connection)."\n\n";
	exit();
	}
echo "Successfully created database!\n\n";
```

The first line, saves the above query into the `$sql` variable.

The next will execute the command into the database using the `mysqli_query()` function. Note that this function takes two arguments, the first is the variable containing the server connection and the second is the sql command (or the variable that holds it). The results of the query will be returned and stored in the `$returnValue` variable. If there is an error, the return result will be 'False' (a boolean value).

The next 'if' block is simply there to catch an error in case the query does not work (ie. when the function returns 'False').

Your final PHP file should look something like this.

```
<?php
    $connection = @mysqli_connect('localhost', 'root', 'password');
    if(mysqli_connect_errno()) {
        echo "Could not connect to server: \n".mysqli_connect_error()."\n";
		exit();
    }
    echo "Connected successfully \n\n";
   
	$sql = "CREATE DATABASE hello_world3";
	$returnValue = mysqli_query( $connection, $sql );
	if (! $returnValue) {
		echo "Could not execute query: \n".mysqli_error($connection)."\n\n";
		exit();
	}
	echo "Successfully created database!\n\n";

	mysqli_close($connection);
?>
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/M/N/H/GhX1fDLKn3MV.jpg)


Now that that is done, save your script and execute it from the command line (make sure your working directory is right).

```
$ php createDatabase.php
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/B/T/Q/M5JPbQ6RdneP.jpg)

The output to your console shows that all was successful. If you open your MySQL client and look at the database lists, you will see that it contains 'hello_world3'.

```
$ mysql -u root -p
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/T/M/U/13ssE1GogzFd.jpg)

###2.4 Dropping a MySQL Database

Now, we don't actually need all of these different databases. The only one that we want to keep is 'Hello_World'. 

So now, what we need to do is drop all of the databases that we don't want. This process is very similar to creating databases, hence this part of the lab will be more fast-paced.

As you may have guessed, 'dropping' is basically the SQL equivalent of deleting something.

####2.4.1 Dropping a Database Using the Command Line

You can drop a database using the MySQL client CLI. Log in if you aren't already and execute the following command (remember, database names are **case-sensitive**). Try it now and then look at the database lists.

```
mysql> DROP DATABASE hello_world;
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/X/R/C/ftLH23xZqIZM.jpg)


As you can see, the database 'hello_world' is gone.

This process is somewhat permanent, so be careful when using this command because the client won't ask you if you're sure you want to drop a database.

####2.4.2 Dropping a Database using mysqladmin

This method of dropping a database is considered the 'safest' (you'll find out why in a minute).

Exit the MySQL client and use the following command to utilize the **mysqladmin** binary for dropping a table.

```
$ mysqladmin -u root -p drop hello_world2
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/T/E/W/0OV4MrtWM9d4.jpg)

Note that you were prompted before the delete took place. This is why this is considered the 'safest' way to drop a table.

If you login to your MySQL client again and look at the database lists, you will see that the 'hello_world2' table has been removed successfully.

![](https://labex.io/upload/D/R/S/JXpc6l91wg5v.jpg)

####2.4.3 Dropping Database using PHP Script

Finally, you can also drop databases using PHP scripts. For this part of the tutorial you can either modify a copy of your `createDatabase` script, or create a new one (which is shown below). Save it in the same place as the last script we created (which should already be your working directory).

Remember to exit your MySQL client first!

```
$ cd ~/phpScripts
$ touch dropDatabase.php
```

The only difference from the previous script (apart from the slightly altered success message) is that the SQL command we're executing has changed to the following.

```
DROP DATABASE hello_world3;
```

Your final PHP script should look something like this.

```
<?php
    $connection = @mysqli_connect('localhost', 'root', 'password');
    if(mysqli_connect_errno()) {
        echo "Could not connect to server: \n".mysqli_connect_error()."\n";
		exit();
    }
    echo "Connected successfully \n\n";
   
	$sql = "DROP DATABASE hello_world3";
	$returnValue = mysqli_query( $connection, $sql );
	if (! $returnValue) {
		echo "Could not execute query: \n".mysqli_error($connection)."\n\n";
		exit();
	}
	echo "Successfully dropped database!\n\n";

	mysqli_close($connection);
?>
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/L/Q/O/HKQYnGMyKyBc.jpg)


Now if you execute it via the command line, you should be able to drop the database.

```
$ php dropDatabase.php
```

Perfect! Log into your MySQL client and view the database list to confirm your success.

![](media/Drop-DB-3.jpg)

Again, this method will not prompt you before dropping a database, so be careful!

###2.5 Selecting a MySQL Database

So far, we have created and destroyed databases using many different methods.

Is there any point to this though? What can we actually do with these databases?

The answer to this question will be explored in the next few labs. However, in this lab, we will briefly learn how to actually select/switch the database that we want to work on.

The process is really simple.

####2.5.1 Select MySQL Database from Command Prompt

The command used to move between different databases on your MySQL server is outlined below (where <Database Name> is the name of the database you wish to move to.

```
USE <Database Name>
```

Try it! Log into your MySQL client and execute the following commands. Remember, you can list all the available tables using the `SHOW TABLES;` command.


```
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
mysql> USE Hello_World;
mysql> SHOW TABLES;
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/F/H/A/Xf5gpsAl6NVC.jpg)

As you can see, we have moved into our 'Hello_World' database. The `show tables` command simply lists the tables found in a database. It returned 'Empty set' because we haven't created any tables yet.

Now switch to a different database, then list the tables there.

```
mysql> USE mysql;
mysql> SHOW TABLES;
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/Y/E/D/VBaD6ZcwG1zv.jpg)

You can see the difference in the output of `show tables` that you have moved into a different database on your server.

####2.5.2 Select MySQL Database Using PHP Script

You can also select a database in a PHP script. Create a new PHP script with the following contents, save it to your phpScripts directory as `selectDatabase.php`.

We will go through this shortly.

```php
<?php
    $connection = @mysqli_connect('localhost', 'root', 'password');
    if(mysqli_connect_errno()) {
        echo "Could not connect to server: \n".mysqli_connect_error()."\n\n";
		exit();
    }
    echo "Connected successfully\n\n";
   
	$success = mysqli_select_db($connection, 'Hello_World');
	if ($success) {
		echo "Successfully selected 'Hello_World'!\n\n";
	}
	$success = 	mysqli_select_db($connection, 'mysql');
	if ($success) {
		echo "Successfully selected 'mysql'!\n\n";
	}
	mysqli_close($connection);
?>
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/F/E/L/hMuQJLA7Bago.jpg)


As you can see (on lines 9 and 13), we have used the `mysqli_select_db()` function. This function is specifically designed to move between databases.

The function takes two parameters. The first is the variable/object that contains the mysql connection (in this case `$connection`) and the second is a string that contains the name of the database you would like to swap to.

The function returns a boolean value. **True** if the select was successful and **False** if it is not. You do not need to assign the output to anything and the function will still be successful, however in this case we will used the output to send us a message if the swap was successful (which is handled by the 'if' blocks that we will add).

Now, let's check if it works. Upon executing this script, we should see two messages indicating that we have successfully selected a new database.

```
$ php selectDataBases.php
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/C/R/U/0uHfHcTxV0Ix.jpg)

Perfect! You have successfully selected databases via a PHP script.

Whilst this may not seem useful now, being able to select databases via PHP is an extremely powerful tool. It can allow a single script to work in different databases, transfer data between them and even transfer data between different MySQL servers!

###2.6 Obtain and Use MySQL Metadata

In MySQL (or any other database management system), the primary goal of a query is to retrieve data from your database. For example, you may want the names and phone numbers of anybody who lives in a particular city.

However, there is also other information that you can retrieve from MySQL. This information can be referred to as *metadata* - data about the data.

####2.6.1 Obtain the Number of Rows Affected by a Query

Open your MySQL client and run the following query on the MySQL database (note that you do not need to specify which database you are using, the query already does this).

```sql
SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;
```
This command will basically list all users for the server.

```sql
mysql> SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/L/A/D/b8pfxhU1vVuD.jpg)

As you can see, the query should list all users for the server (and their hosts). Take note that this query has returned 5 rows (as MySQL states beneath the table).

When your working with PHP scripts, you can also retrieve information about the number of rows that have been affected by a query.

Write a new script that connects to your MySQL server (as follows). Save it with your other scripts and call it `obtainingMysqlMetadata.php`.

```php
<?php
    $connection = @mysqli_connect('localhost', 'root', 'beechmont');
    if(mysqli_connect_errno()) {
        echo "Could not connect to server: \n".mysqli_connect_error()."\n";
		exit();
    }
    echo "Connected successfully\n\n";
   
	// List the number of rows affected by a query.

	// List tables and databases.

	// Getting server metadata.

	
	mysqli_close($connection);
?>
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/P/H/X/Fl4OiTnSGYfa.jpg)

In order to retrieve the number of rows affected by a query (or rows that are selected by a query) in PHP, you can use the `mysqli_affected_rows()` function. This function takes one parameter which is the connection object of the relevant server. Its return value is an integer.

Add the following lines to your PHP script below the first comment.

```php
	$result = mysqli_query($connection, "Select user, host from mysql.user");
	$rows = mysqli_affected_rows($connection);
	printf("Affected rows (selected rows): $rows\n\n");
```

The first line executes the query we used above, the second utilizes the `mysqli_affected_rows()` function and the last prints the number of affected rows in the last query (which is saved in the `$rows` variable).

If you save your PHP script and run it from the command line, you should see an output containing the same number you found earlier using the MySQL client (which in this example is 5, though yours may vary).

```
$ php obtainingMysqlMetadata.php
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/S/T/Q/qKHlyjVNsKW3.jpg)

Perfect!

####2.6.2 List Tables and Databases

Previously, we have listed tables and databases using the `show databases;` and `show tables;` MySQL commands.

In previous versions of PHP, there were special functions that returned database lists and table lists. However, in more recent versions (ie. PHP7.0 with *mysqli*), these functions were removed. Instead we can just execute the `show databases;` and `show tables;` commands as a query in our PHP script.

Add the following lines beneath the second comment in your PHP script.

```
	mysqli_free_result($result);
	
	$query = "show databases";

	if ($result = mysqli_query($connection, $query)){
		while ($row = mysqli_fetch_row($result)) {
			printf($row[0]."\n");
		}
		printf("\n");
	}

	mysqli_free_result($result);
```

Don't panic. We will cover retrieving data from queries in later labs. However, the second line simply assigns the `show databases;` MySQL command to the `$query` variable. The next 'if' block executes the query using `mysqli_query()` function and saves the output to `$result`. The 'while' loop in the block simply iterates over the data in `$result` and prints it to the console.

Save your script file and run it again from the command line.
```
$ php obtainingMysqlMetadata.php
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/B/B/P/I6iLx07y9HGK.jpg)

Perfect! As you can see, all of our database names have been printed to the console.

###2.7 Getting Server Metadata

There are also a number of in-built MySQL commands that can be used to retrieve metadata about your MySQL server. Open your MySQL client and try them yourself.

#### 2.7.1 Server Version

The following MySQL command can be used to return the server version.

```sql
mysql> SELECT VERSION();
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/U/V/T/dHR16e8KVKeT.jpg)


#### 2.7.2 Selected Database

The following MySQL command can be used to return the current database that you are working in. Try using it before and after you have entered your 'Hello_World' database.

```sql
mysql> SELECT DATABASE();
mysql> USE Hello_World;
mysql> SELECT DATABASE();
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/T/V/F/jbfeBOMUWC59.jpg)


#### 2.7.3 Current User

The following MySQL command can be used to return details about the user that you are currently using. Try it!

```sql
mysql> SELECT USER();
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/I/N/H/XAMze53uT1OB.jpg)

#### 2.7.4 Status Indicators and Configuration Variables

The output of the following commands will not be shown due to their output length, but you can test them in your environment.

The following MySQL command can be used to show all server status indicators.

```sql
mysql> SHOW STATUS;
```

Finally, the following MySQL command can be used to show all server configuration variables.

```sql
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES;
```

#### Getting Server Metadata from a PHP Script

These commands can also be run from a PHP script using the `mysqli_query()` function. Add the following lines of code below the third comment in our php script. These will execute `SELECT VERSION()` and print the result (in the same way that we did before).

```php
	$query = "select version()";
	
	if ($result = mysqli_query($connection, $query)){
		printf("MySQL Version: ".mysqli_fetch_row($result)[0]."\n\n");
	}

	mysqli_free_result($result);
```

Good, now save and run the script. As you can see, the script will now return the version of our server as well.

![](https://labex.io/upload/B/W/A/IifQgt2pF8IP.jpg)

###2.8 Exporting a MySQL Database

#### 2.8.1 Making a Script

Another feature of MySQL is that it supports easy importing and exporting of data. For this next exercise, we will need to create a table. The following SQL commands will do this for you. You can either copy and paste the SQL into your MySQL client directly (all at once) or make it into a script and execute it (we will show this below). MAKE SURE THAT YOU EXECUTE `USE Hello_World;` BEFORE YOU DO THIS.

```sql
mysql> USE Hello_World;
```

```sql
Create Table Person (
	personID Char(8) NOT NULL,
	firstName Varchar(30) NOT NULL,
	lastName Varchar(20) NOT NULL,
	streetNo Varchar(10) NOT NULL,
	streetName Varchar(20) NOT NULL,
	city Varchar(30) NOT NULL,
	state Varchar(4) NOT NULL,
	postcode Char(4) NOT NULL,
	dateOfBirth Date NOT NULL,
	email Varchar(50) NOT NULL,
	sex Char(1) NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY(personID),
	CONSTRAINT sex_value CHECK (sex IN ('M','F','U')),
	CONSTRAINT email_value CHECK (email LIKE '%___@___%')
);

commit;
```

If you wish to make a script, just copy and paste all of this text into a new file in any text editor. Then save it as `createTable.sql`.

To execute this script, open your MySQL client and execute the following. Note that the second command does NOT HAVE A SEMICOLON AT THE END.

```sql
mysql> USE Hello_World;
mysql> \. <Absolute Path to Script File>
```

Ensure that you include the ABSOLUTE file path WITHOUT QUOTES on the ends - even if the path contains spaces. A quick way to get the absolute path is to simply click-and-drag the script file from a file browser into your MySQL terminal window - if you do this, remember to remove the quotes from either side of your path (because Linux puts them in automatically, but we need to remove them).

![](https://labex.io/upload/K/A/U/BZUokBhtqLFd.jpg)


Now, if you execute `show tables;`, you will see that a new table has been created.

```
mysql> SHOW TABLES;
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/U/U/W/ZWjr3wPyvh5q.jpg)

####2.8.2 SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE Statement

To export data from a database table, you can use the `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` command.

You can basically use this command to export the data returned by any query into an external file. Note that it will not work if the output file already exists.

When exporting using this method, the output file must be in a secure location on your system that is designated by MySQL. To look at what your location is, use the following command.

```
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "secure_file_priv";
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/K/X/G/i3crJIhiWXg8.jpg)

As you can see, the output displays a folder. This is the location in which your import/export files need to be held. If your file is different from the one shown, you will need to alter the path in the following command accordingly.

Execute the following command and if necessary, alter the path.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Person INTO OUTFILE '/var/lib/mysql-files/personData.txt';
```

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM Person INTO OUTFILE '/var/lib/mysql-files/personData.txt';
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/Y/L/D/rMmGpRPisunv.jpg)

Now, if you exit your MySQL client (or open a new terminal) and execute the following command. You will see the contents of your file. Note that you may need root privileges on your operating system to do this (Remember, alter the file path as appropriate).

```shell
$ sudo gedit /var/lib/mysql-files/personData.txt

####2.8.3 Exporting Table as Raw Data

Using the `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` command exports a query as raw data. You can also use the **mysqldump** binary to do the same task for the contents of an entire table. This binary calls `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` internally, however the difference is that it can be used outside of the MySQL client. The general syntax of this command is outlined below. Note that using the `--no-create-info` tag makes the command export raw data (like before).

```shell
$ mysqldump -u <username> -p --no-create-info --tab=<Export file directory> <Database name> <Table name>
```

Again, because SQL is so secure, data can only be exported to the special directory designated by MySQL. Again, if executing the following, make sure you specify the correct path. On a Unix system, you may need root (sudo) privileges to do this as well.

```shell
$ sudo mysqldump -u root -p --no-create-info --tab=/var/lib/mysql-files/ Hello_World Person
```

Now, if you open the relevant file in a text editor...

```shell
$ sudo gedit /var/lib/mysql-files/Person.txt
```

The output file is the same as before (raw data).

####2.8.4 Exporting Table Contents/Definitions in SQL

You can also export data as an `.sql` file which is basically an SQL script that contains the complete instructions on recreating the table and adding all the data back into it. Fortunately, this can be created in any folder without needing special permissions. This is also done using **mysqldump**.

```
$ mysqldump -u <username> -p <database name> <table name> > <output file>
```

Try the following command.

```
$ mysqldump -u root -p Hello_World Person > createPerson.sql
```

You can now open the SQL file and view its contents.

```
$ gedit createPerson.sql
```

Note that you can also save the contents as any file type you want, for example a simple text file. Do this now.

```
$ mysqldump -u root -p Hello_World Person > createPerson.txt
```

Any output files like this can be used to move data to an entirely different MySQL server if desired.

###2.9 Importing a Database

Before the next couple of tutorials, we will need to copy one of our other raw data files into our current directory (to make access easier). Run the following command (replacing the file target if you must).

```shell
$ sudo cp /var/lib/mysql-files/Person.txt .
```

This will have copied one of your raw data files into the current directory for easier use in the next few steps.

The following process (of importing data) is extremely useful. It can be used to restore a backup your data (created using an export), as well as transfer it between databases and even different host servers.

####2.9.1 Importing Data with LOAD DATA

Log back into your MySQL client and run the following.

```sql
mysql> USE Hello_World;
mysql> DELETE FROM Person;
```

This will have successfully deleted all records from the Person table. Run the following to verify that the table is empty.

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM Person;
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/V/C/V/3WbUDKCeuR3K.jpg)

As you can see, there are no records in our Person table anymore.

Now, run the following command.

```sql
$ mysql ---local-infile --u root -p
mysql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'Person.txt' INTO TABLE Person;
```

The `LOAD DATA` statement is basically a bulk data loader. It basically reads a file that you specify (in this case 'Person.txt' and adds it to a table you specify). Using `LOCAL` in this command will allow you to specify relative paths for a raw input file.

As you can see, the command has imported 18 records. To verify that our data is in the Person table again, run the following query.

```
mysql> SELECT * FROM Person;
```

Success! It has worked.

####2.9.2 Importing Data with mysqlimport

Similar to exporting data using **mysqldump**, you can also import data outside of the MySQL client using the **mysqlimport** binary. As expected, this binary will implicitly call `LOAD DATA`.

Remove all records from the 'Person' table again.

```sql
mysql> DELETE FROM Person;
```

Good, now log out of your MySQL client and execute the following command.

```shell
$ mysqlimport -u <username> -p --local Hello_World Person.txt
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/O/G/F/eGbdz2Bi6PCu.jpg)

Good, as you can see, all 18 rows have been imported. You can log into your MySQL client and will find that the data is now in the 'Person' table just as before.

####2.9.3 Importing Data from Complete Schema

When we were importing, we have been using raw data files. However, recall that we also exported non-raw files that contained the table schema as well as the data. You won't have success importing these files using the tools shown above.

Instead you can simply run these files because they are basically scripts. We did this briefly when we first added the data to the table.

When you're logged into your MySQL client and are working in the 'Hello_World' database, run the following commands (the first will drop the table).

```sql
mysql> DROP TABLE Person;
mysql> \. ./createPerson.sql
```

As you can see from the output, the table has been created from the data in `createPerson.txt`. It didn't matter that the file didn't have the `.sql` extension, it still acted like a script.

## 3. Summary

Congratulations on finishing Lab 2! In the next lab, we will be looking at the different data types that are available in MySQL and how we can use them to store our data.
