# SQL Constraints

## 1. Introduction

Constraint in SQL is a limitation that ensures the integrity and uniqueness of the data in a table by limiting the data in the rows or columns of the table. This lab will walk you through and get you familiar with several constraints in MySQL by practicing.

### Learning Objective

-  Comprehend the essence of MySQL constraints

###Operating Environment

The lab environment used in this course is Ubuntu Linux 14.04 64-bit, also we will use the following programs:

- Mysql 5.5.50
- Xfce terminal

### 2.1 Types of Constraints

From the name, it's easy to see that constraint is a restriction that ensures the integrity and uniqueness of the data in the table by limiting the data in the table's rows or columns.

In MySQL, the following constraints are commonly used:

| Constraint type： | Primary Key | Default | Unique | Foreign Key | Not Null |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------- | ------ | ----------- | -------- |
| Keywords：        | PRIMARY KEY | DEFAULT | UNIQUE | FOREIGN KEY | NOT NULL |

### 2.2 Construct Table for Constraints

In order to facilitate the flow of introducing these forms of constraints, first let's create a database.


You don't need to create the database from scratch. LabEx has already done that for you. First open Xfce terminal and input the command below to enter `/home/labex/Desktop` directory:

```shell
cd Desktop
```

Use the git command to download the required data files to your local folder:

```shell
wget https://labexfile.oss-us-west-1-internal.aliyuncs.com/courses/7/MySQL-03-01.sql
```

After the download is complete, enter the command to start the MySQL service and log in as root:

start MySQL service
```shell
sudo service mysql start        
```
log in as root
```shell
mysql -u root                   
```

The file contains the code to create a new database` mysql_lab`, and then create three tables `department`,` employee`, `project` in the new database. They contain a variety of constraints.

Load the data in the file, and you need to enter the command in the MySQL console:

```
source /home/labex/Desktop/MySQL-03-01.sql;
```

Double check this database and enter command `show tables;` and you'll see:

### 2.3 Primary Key Constraint

PRIMARY KEY is used to constrain a row in the table, as a unique identifier for this row. A specific row in a table can be positioned accurately using the primary key, hence the primary key is very important. Primary key cannot be repeated and can't be empty.

In `MySQL-03-01.sql`，we have primary key：

you can also define primary key like this：

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/T/A/D/PKVMH6V2XzR2.png)

There is also a special primary key - a composite primary key. The primary key can not only be a single column in the table, it can also be two or more columns in the table to identify jointly, such as:

### 2.4 Default Constraint

DEFAULT specifies that in columns with a DEFAULT constraint, default values are used when the inserted data is empty.

In `MySQL-03-01.sql`，the code below includes DEFAULT constraint：

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/L/Y/J/8ZhaBT1KExzz.png)

DEFAULT constraints will only be reflected in the use of the INSERT statement (introduced in the previous lab). If there is no value in the INSERT statement where DEFAULT is constrained, then this position will be filled with the value of DEFAULT, such as:


Insert data
```
INSERT INTO department(dpt_name,people_num) VALUES('dpt1',11);
```

Insert new data, people_num is empty, use default value
```
INSERT INTO department(dpt_name) VALUES('dpt2');  
```

Enter command `SELECT * FROM department;`, see the people_num in the second row is filled with DEFAULT value (10):

### 2.5 Unique Constraint

UNIQUE constraint is relative easy. It specifies that the value of a column specified in a table must not have duplicate values, that is, each value in this column is unique.

In `MySQL-03-01.sql`，we also have UNIQUE constraint：

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/K/U/D/CfkgdGYRBNJ1.png)

When the new data inserted by INSERT statement is repeated with pre-existing one, and there is a UNIQUE constraint, then the INSERT will fail, such as:

```
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(01,'Tom',25,3000,110110,'dpt1');
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(02,'Jack',30,3500,110110,'dpt2'); 
```

See the result below：

### 2.6 Foreign Key Constraint

Foreign key can not only ensure data integrity, but also display the relationship between the tables.

A table can have multiple foreign keys, and each foreign key must refer to the primary key of another table. In the column constrained by a foreign key, the value must have a corresponding value in the column it refers to.

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/I/Q/S/EZU8pVkOTTer.png)

* 1: name of Foreign Key (customizable)
* 2: in_dpt is Foreign Key
* 3: REFERENCE column is dpt_name in department table

When we insert, if the value constrained by foreign key cannot find a corresponding value in the reference column, such as in the example below - no dpt3 in the reference column (dpt-name in department table), then the INSERT fails:

```
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(02,'Jack',30,3500,114114,'dpt3');
```

The insertion is successful when we change dpt3 to dpt2 (dpt2 in department table):

### 2.7 Not Null Constraint

If a row is contrained by not null constraint, then its value must not be empty.

Violation of not null constraint in MySQL will not report error. There will only be a warning, such as in the following situation:


INSERT successful; age is empty，because there is no not null constraint; NULL is displayed

```
INSERT INTO employee(id,name,salary,phone,in_dpt) VALUES(03,'Jim',3400,119119,'dpt2'); 
```

Warning: salary is constrained by not null constraint; value is empty; 0 is displayed in table

```
INSERT INTO employee(id,name,age,phone,in_dpt) VALUES(04,'Bob',23,123456,'dpt1'); 
```

The results is shown in the figure below. There is a warning, but still successfully insert the data. LabEx environment is `5.5.50`. MySQL version of ` 5.6` or higher will report error, and prohibit the insertion of data that does not meet the not null constraints:

Now the content of the employee table is:

## 3. Summary

By walking through a database example, we've learnt the features of primary key, default, foreign key, not null and unique constraints. These types of constraints are very common and widely used, so please be sure to master those constraints. Next lab we will learn SELECT statement.

## 4. Homework

Complete the entire procedure according to instructions in this lab: first with the ready-made data files to create a database, and then test the various statements of the process, try and verify the role of various constraints. Take screenshots of your process if needed.
