# Variable and Operator
Like other programming language, the basic syntax of Java is simple, if you have learnd other high-level language, you can see some similar features here, if not, you can also get through very easily.
##1. Experiment Introduction
In this section, you'll learn how to declare different types of varibles and assignment, several primitive data types, their differences and different operators expressions.
###Learning Objective

### 2.1 Variables & Data Types 
One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate variables. A variable is a named location that stores a value. Values are things that can be printed, stored and (as we’ll see later) operated on. To store a value, you have to create a variable firstly.

*Note: if the code blow have a class with the main function, please type those code and save to a file with the same name as the class name in the file.*

In Java, there are several [primitive datatypes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html "primitive datatypes") (built-in types in language): byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char. Each variable has a type that determines what kind of values it can store. For example, the int type can store integers, and the char type can store character. To create an integer variable, the syntax is int i, where i is the arbitrary name you made up for the variable. In general, you will want to make up variable names that indicate what you plan to do with the variable. For example, if you saw these variable declarations: you could guess what values would be stored in them. This example also demonstrates the syntax for declaring multiple variables with the same type.

**Example**

    public class variableTest{
    	public static void main(String[] args){
          // byte b = 0;       
          // short s = 1;      
          // int i =	0;     
          // long l = 0L;      
          // float f = 0.0f;   
          // double d = 0.0d;  
          // char c = 'c';     
          boolean isRight = false ;    // declare and assign value
          int hour, minute = 60;	   // hour just declared
          hour = 24;				   // hour assigned value
          System.out.println("isRight? " + isRight);
          System.out.println("hour = " + hour);
          System.out.println("minute = " + minute);
      }
    }

**Output:**

    isRight? false
    hour = 24
    minute = 60
For how to use Eclipse, you can refer to our previus section, here we just show you the result.

### 2.2 Operators
#### 2.2.1 The arithmetic operators
Operators are symbols used to represent computations like addition and multiplication. Most operators in Java do what you expect them to do because they are common mathematical symbols.

-  operator for addition is +
-  operator for subtraction is -
-  operator for multiplication is *
-  operator for division is /
-  operator for remainder after division is %
-  operator for increament is ++
-  operator for decreament is --.

Addition, subtraction and multiplication all do what you expect, but you might be surprised by division. For example, this program，write these code and save to a file with the same name as the class name that is arithmeticOperatorTest.java.

**Example**

    public class arithmeticOperatorTest
    {
        public static void main(String[] args){
            int hour = 10, minute = 60;
    	    hour++;       // hour = 11
    	    minute--;     // minute = 59
    	    System.out.println("Number of minutes: " + (hour*60 + minute));
    	    System.out.println("Fraction of the hour that has passed: " + (minute / 60));
    		System.out.println("The reminder of minute divided by hour: " + (minute % hour));
        }
    }
**Output:**

    Number of minutes: 719
    Fraction of the hour that has passed: 0
    The reminder of minute divided by hour: 4

The first line is expected, but the second line is odd. The value of minute is 59, and 59 divided by 60 is 0.98333, not 0. The problem is that Java is performing integer division. When both operands are integers (operands are the things operators operate on), the result is also an integer, and by convention integer division always rounds down, even in cases like this where the next integer is so close.

#### 2.2.2 The bitwise operators
The bitwise opereators enable you  to manipulate integer, short, long, byte bit-by-bit.

- & (and): Copy a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.
- | (or): Copy a bit if it exists in either operand
- ^ (XOR): Copy the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.
- ~ (overturn): Overturn a bit (1->0 or 0->1).
- << (left shift): The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand
- &gt;&gt; (right shift): The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.

**Example**

    public class bitwiseOperatorTest
    {
        public static void main(String[] args){
    	    int a = 0b00111100, b = 0b00001101;     // a is 60, b is 13
    	    System.out.println("a & b: " + (a&b));  // 00001100(in tens:12)
    	    System.out.println("a | b: " + (a|b));  // 00111101(in tens:61)
    	    System.out.println("a ^ b: " + (a^b));  // 00110001(in tens:49)
    	    System.out.println("~ b: " + (~b));     // 11110010(in tens:-14)
        }
    }

**Output:**
    a & b: 12
    a | b: 61
    a ^ b: 49
    ~ b: -14

#### 2.2.3 The logical operators

- && (logical and): If both the operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.
- || (logical or): If any of the two operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.
- ! (logical not): Reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true then this operator will make false.

**Example**

    public class logicalOperatorTest
    {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        	boolean a = true;
        	boolean b = false;
    	    System.out.println("a && b = " + (a&&b));
    	    System.out.println("a || b = " + (a||b));
    	    System.out.println("!(a && b) = " + !(a && b));
       	}
    }

**Output:**

    a && b = false
    a || b = true
    !(a && b) = true

## 3. Summary

For now, you have already learned some basic data types of Java and three types of operators, you can try to use these basic skills to fullfill a simple calculator.
