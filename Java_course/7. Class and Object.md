# Class & Object #

## 1. Introduction

In this lab, you are going to learn a very important programming pattern: the object-oriented-programming. You need to know the difference between class and object. Take more practice to get better understanding.

### Learning Objective

- Class and Object
- Concept and Difference

### 2.1 Class and Object 
There are many programming languages and almost as many programming styles (sometimes called paradigms). The programs we have written so far are mainly procedural, because the emphasis has been on specifying computational procedures. Most Java programs are object-oriented, which means that the focus is on objects and their interactions. Here are some of the characteristics of object-oriented programming:

Objects often represent entities in the real world. The majority of methods are object methods (like the methods you invoke on Strings) rather than class methods (like the Math methods). The methods we have written so far have been class methods. In this chapter we write some object methods.

Objects are isolated from each other by limiting the ways they interact, especially by preventing them from accessing instance variables without invoking methods. Classes are organized in family trees where new classes extend existing classes, adding new methods and replacing others.

In Java, all classes extend some other class. The most basic class is called Object. It contains no instance variables, but it provides the methods equals and toString, among others.

Many classes extend Object, including almost all of the classes we have written and many Java classes, like Integer, Double, String, Array, etc. Any class that does not explicitly name a parent inherits from Object by default. The “family tree” of classes is called the class hierarchy. Object usually appears at the top, with all the “child” classes below. 

Classes and objects usually have some attributes which are used to describe these classes/objects, and the methods are used to perform some specific functions. Here we give you an example to show you what a class is like, save these code to objectTest.java, and use command line to run these code.

**Example**
```java
// use keyword class to create a new class named Person
class Person
{
    /*
     * there are four properties,
     * name of string type, age of int type
     * gender of string type, weight of float type
    */
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private String gender;
    private float weight;
    // this is a constructor with no return type, the same name as the class, no parameters
    public Person(){
    
    }
    this is a constructor with two parameters
    public Person(String name, int age){
        // use parameters to set objects name and age
    	this.name = name;
    	this.age = age;
    }
    // this is a constructor with four parameters
    public Person(String name, int age, String gender, float weight){
        // use parameters to set objects name, age, gender and weight
    	this.name = name;
    	this.age = age;
    	this.gender = gender;
    	this.weight = weight;
    }
       // this is an object method
    public void personInfo(){
    	System.out.println("Name: " + this.name + "\nAge: "+ this.age + "\nGender: " + this.gender + "\nWeight: "+this.weight);
	}
}
    
public class objectTest{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        // use new to create an instance of class Person
        Person p = new Person("aaa",18,"male",50.5f);  // p refers to  an object
        /* you can try these two different construction methods, and see what the output is.
         * Person p  = new Person();
         * Person p = new Person("aaa",18);
        */
        // use object to invoke method personInfo()
        p.personInfo();
    }
}
```
**output:** 
```
Name: aaa
Age: 18
Gender: male
Weight: 50.5
```

There are four attributors in the `Person` class, all the attributors are private, they cann't be accessed outside (only used inner the class). There is one object method named personInfo used to print personal infomation, and there are three construction methods(usually called constructor) with the same name as the class name `Person`, the only difference is their parameters which we call overload (we'll talk about later).

## 3. Exercise

In our upper case, we created a `Person` class. First, add the set/get methods for each of its attributes. Practice to use these methods. Then, in some case, we don't know the source code of `Person`, we created an instance of Person class, we want to know what methods and properties this object has, get them as an array of string.

```java
public class objectTest{
 	public static void main(String[] args){
        Person p = new Person();
        String[] methods, props;
        // get all methods and properties `p` has and store in methods and props, 
        // and then print them out.
        // write your code here
    }   
}
```

> See what `Object.getClass()` ,`Method`, `Field`  and  some other methods of these classes.

## 4. Summary

This part is very important, classes are abstraction of entities with common features, objects are entities with specific features. You should take more time to understand the programming thought mentioned above.
