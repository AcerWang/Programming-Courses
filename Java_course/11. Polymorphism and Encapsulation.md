# Polymorphism & Encapsulation

## 1. Introduction

Encapsulation is like a bag. That encloses the related operations and data related to an object into it. Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In this lab, you will see what they are like.

### 2.1 Polymorphism

Polymorphism is one of the OOPs feature that allows us to perform a single action in different ways. Polymorphism that is resolved during compiler time is static polymorphism or compile time Polymorphism (overloading is of this type), Polymorphism that is resolved during runtime is called runtime polymorphism (overriding is of this type). Polymorphism also has the feature of an object to take on many forms. A very common use of polymorphism in OOP is when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object. Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic. A reference variable can refer to any object of its declared type or any subtype of its declared type. A reference variable can be declared as a class or interface type. The  case in Inheritance is one form of polymorphism, because there are different kind of animals behave animal's features. But here, we introduce another form of polymorphism.

**Example**

```java
// we declare an interface life, it has some methods we just omit them.
interface life{}
// and declare a class to realize polymorphism, the inner content, we just ignore them for this case.
class Animal{}
// we declare a Human class to use class of Animal and the life interface.
class Human extends Animal implements life{}

public class polymorphismTest{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Human human = new Human();  // instance a Human object
		// Human has direct or indirect inheritance relationship with Animal, Object
		// Human implement life interface, so the instanceof expression return true
		System.out.println("human is instance of Human? " + (human instanceof Human));
		System.out.println("human is instance of Animal? " + (human instanceof Animal));
		System.out.println("human is instance of life? " + (human instanceof life));
		System.out.println("human is instance of Object? " + (human instanceof Object));
	}
}
```

**Output:**

```
human is instance of Human? true
human is instance of Animal? true
human is instance of life? true
human is instance of Object? true
```

### 2.2 Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a concept that we hide the details of programs, other invokers just need to know what the program can give you without knowing how it works. Encapsulation simplify the development. It is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as data hiding. Commonly, the class fields are declared private, we use getter/setter methods to access and control data, we define public methods just to provide functionalities to other classes or ouside usage. sometimes, we define private methods which are just used in the class for some specific usage. This is how we hide details.

**Example**

```java
class Person{
    /*
     * there are two member variables in Person
     * they are private, so cann't be accessed out of this class directly.
    */
	private String name;
	private int age;
	// empty constructor 
	public Person(){
	
	}
	// constructor with two parameters
	public Person(String name,int age){
		this.name = name;
		this.age = age;
	}
    // use this method to get name value
	public String getName(){
		return this.name;
	}
	// use this method to set name value
	public void setName(String name){
		this.name = name;
	}
	// use this method to get age value
	public int getAge(){
		return this.age;
	}
	// use this method to set age value
	public void setAge(int age){
		this.age = age;
	}
}
public class encapsulationTest{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Person p = new Person();
		// we set a person's name and age using setXXX() method
		p.setName("Mike");
		p.setAge(20);
		// we get a person's name and age using getXXX() method
		System.out.println("Name: " + p.getName() + ", Age: " + p.getAge());
	}
}
```

**Output:**

```
Name: Mike, Age: 20
```

## 3. Exercise

Look at the first example, assume that there is a method `feed()` in `Human`, it is used to feed animal, just print the animal's name in this method. And we create two classes `Dog`, `Cat`, even more other kinds of species which inherit from `Animal` class, we want to use `feed()` method to be able to feed all kinds of animals, how to design this method.

```java
// usage of feed method
Dog dog = new Dog();
Cat cat = new Cat();
Human human = new Human();
human.feed(dog);
human.feed(cat);
// human.feed(other_animal);
// how to implement feed method, what's the parameter type to choose
```

> Don't use overloading, only use one method to meet various application scenarios. Use the polymorphism concept.

## 4. Summary

By encapsulation, we donn't need to access object data or properties directly using object.XXX , we use some standard method in form of getXXX(), setXXX() and other methods to do the task. In generic programming, the advatage of polymorphism will be showed up, but now you just remember polymorphism make object take on many forms.
