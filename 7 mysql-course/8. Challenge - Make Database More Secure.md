# Make Database More Secure

## Introduction

We know that root has a supreme right, both in Linux and in the MySQL database, and it has almost all rights. In our environment, the root account of our MySQL does not have a password, which means that anyone can login. This is extremely insecure, because hackers can easily delete files or make extortion, so we need to set a complex password `4nM1ruJNqL1D` for root account. At the same time we need to create an account called `labex` and grant `Challenge01` database table all read-only permissions (that is, only query) for our daily data query, so as to avoid accidentally deleted data. We'll use the database created by the previous challenge to operate. 

## Objective

1. Create login password `4nM1ruJNqL1D` for `root` account
2. Create `labex` account and its password is`Xd4a8lKjeL9Z`; authorize it the read-only permission of  `Challenge01`

## Key Points

1. Create account password
2. Create account
3. Authroize permission
