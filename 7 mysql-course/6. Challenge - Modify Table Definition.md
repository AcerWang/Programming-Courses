# Modify Table Definition

## Introduction

In this challenge we created a database named `Challenge01`, a course selection system, which we improved to import the database in such a way that:

1. First, enter the desktop directory in the Xfce Terminal, cloning the challenge project to the environment:

```bash
wget https://labexfile.oss-us-west-1-internal.aliyuncs.com/courses/7/Challenge01.txt
```

2. Start the MySQL service, enter the MySQL command line mode, import the relevant data through the file:

```bash
$ source /home/labex/Challenge01.txt
```

After running, we want to add a notification function, which is notified by SMS after the user successfully selected the class, but there is no field of user contact information in the student table. We want to add a `s_phone` column (11 variable-length characters) used to store the user's phone number, making the table structure as follows:

```bash
ID(s_id)|Name(s_name)|Gender(s_sex)|Age(s_age)|Phone number（s_phone）
```

And update the phone number of `labex1005` to `12948623179`

## Objective

1. Import into the database and add a cell phone number column in the student table
2. Update the phone number of `labex1005` to `12948623179`

## Key Points

1. Add column to table
2. Update column to table
