## Introduction

Please clone the entire project to LabEx environment in a specified address, and then create `dev` branch. We need to add README-new.md file in `dev` branch. 

## Objective

2. Create and switch to dev branch
3. Add and commit README-new.md file in dev branch

## Standard

1. Remote repository address `https://github.com/LabExCoding/gitproject`. Keep the project name in `gitproject`, in path `/home/labex/gitproject`（`gitproject` is the repository directory，files in this directory is the files of gitproject repository）
2. Add `labex development` into README-new.md
