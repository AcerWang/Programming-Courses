# File and Directory

## 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Content

This lab will introduce basic concepts of Linux directory strucure, absolute path, relative path, as well as the cut, copy, rename, edit and other operations of files. Same as other labs, all of those will be accomplished through hands-on practices and exercises. 

#### 1.2 Key Points

- General Content of each Directory
- Attributes of a File
- `touch`,`file`,`rm`,`mv` commands

## 2. Directory Structure in Linux

There is not much of a big difference in terms of general operations of Windows and Linux, but for implementation, the mechanism is completely different.

One of the differences is the relation between directory and storage media (Disk, memory, DVD). Windows uses disk symbol (C disk, D disk) to achieve file management, so directory management is not irreplacable. Not only system files, other filse can also store in any directory. Therefore when you use Windows, it is common that after some time, the files on the disk will be messy.

However, UNIX is different. It is directory-based, and Linux has inherited this excellent feature. Linux has a tree-like directory structure to build the entire system. Whether it is a directory structure or an operating system kernel, they are all stored on disk. But logically, Linux's disk is mounted on the directory. Each directory not only can use file system on the local disk partition, but also can use the file system on the network. For example, you can use the Network File System (NFS) server to load a specific directory.

### 2.1 FHS standard

The basic logic behind Linux directory is that the normal operation of the system is based on directory structure. In most cases beginners do not know the role of the majority of directories in Linux, especially those who only used Windows befor. They would be confused about where they installed the softwares. However, after you've familiarized yourself with Linux, you will find it much simpler and convenient than you imagine. The directory structure in Linux has been set (FHS standard). After you understand the principles of Linux, all your operations on the system will become organized and will be in neat order.

> FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard): Most Linux versions use this file structure. FHS defines the use of each area in the system, the minimum required file, and the directory also gives exception handling and contradiction handling.

FHS defines two specifications.

1) The various directories below `/` should be put specific files, such as setting files should be placed in the directory `/etc` and executable files should be placed in `/bin`, `/sbin`.

2) There are explicit definitions of the subdirectories of the two directories `/usr` and `/var`, such as` /var/log` to place the system login file and `/usr/share` to place shared data.

[FHS_2.3](http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_2.3/fhs-2.3.pdf)  

**If you think the picture is blurry. You can save it and zoom in View:**

You can also execute the following command to view the entire directory structure:

```
$ tree /
```

If "command not found" pops up, you should install it first:

```
# the environment is initialized when the lab is started. You need to manually update apt-get so that we can find the source of the corresponding package when we install it.

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install tree
```

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'tree' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "tree" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```


### 2.2 Directory path

#### What's "path"?

You may not fully understand what's path and what's it used for. The path is the route of where you go. If you want to enter a specific directory or want to fetch a file, you can use path to find the directory or the file.

Use `cd` command to switch directories. In Linux, `.` represents the current directory and `..`represents the upper directory (**Note that the files that begin with`.` are  hidden files. So these two directories must also be hidden, you can use the` ls-a` command to view hidden files**）. `-` represents the last used directory. `~`  represents the current user's home directory. Use `pwd` command to get the current path (absolute path).

Go to the upper directory：

```
$ cd ..
```

Go to your home directory：

```
$ cd ~ 
```

Use `pwd` to get the current path：

```
$ pwd
```


#### Absolute path

The **absolute path** contains the root directory and all other subdirectories in which a file or folder is contained. For example: `/usr/local/bin` indicates the bin directory in the local directory in the usr directory of the root directory.


#### Relative path

Relative path is defined as path related to the present working directory (pwd). Suppose I am located in /var/log and I want to change directory to /var/log/kernel, I can use relative path concept to change directory to kernel

changing directory to /usr/local/bin by using relative path concept.

> ```
> cd ~
> cd ../../usr/local/bin
> ```

Whether you use an absolute path or a relative path, you can go to another directory.

**Tip: In the process of switching the directory, please use `Tab` to automatically fill the path , which can avoid input errors. Press `Tab` twice to show all results.**

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'cd' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "cd" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
## 3. The Basic Operations of Linux Files
- Create
- Copy
- Delete
- Move files & rename files
- View files
- View the file type
- Edit files
### 3.1 Create

#### 3.1.1 Create a new file

You can use `touch` to create a new file. For this command, the main function is to change the timestamp of an existing file (for example, modifying recent access time, most recently) . But if the command `touch` does not add any parameter and only specify a file name, we can create an empty file. More details about the use of  `touch` will be covered in the next lab.

The following commands will create an empty file named "test". Because you do not have permission in other directories, you need to use `cd ~` to switch back to the user's ` / home / labex` directory:

```
$ cd ~
$ touch test
```

#### 3.1.2 Create a new directory

The command `mkdir` (make directories) can create an empty directory. You can also specify the permission attribute of the directory.

Creating an empty directory named "mydir":

```
$ mkdir mydir
```

Using `mkdir` with the -p parameter can create the parent directory if the parent directory does not exist. We create multi-level directories (this is useful when installing the software and configuring the installation path):

```
$ mkdir -p father/son/grandson
```

![image desc5](https://labex.io/upload/T/U/R/FxyQ0jO0jwCj.jpeg)

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'touch' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "touch" cmd.
  timeout: 3
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'mkdir' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "mkdir" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 3.2 Copy

#### 3.2.1 Copy files

You can use `cp` to replicate a file to the specified directory.

Copy the previously created "test" file to "/home/labex/father/son/grandson" :

```
$ cp test father/son/grandson
```

#### 3.2.2 Copy directories

The following error will occur when you directly use the `cp` to copy a directory:

![image desc6](https://labex.io/upload/R/X/Y/VKeOrZF2QFeB.jpeg)


`cp` with-r or -R parameter can work. The parameter represents recursive copy:

```
$ cp -r father family
```

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'cp' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "cp" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```

### 3.3 Delete

#### 3.3.1 Delete Files

Use the command `rm` to delete a file:

```
$ rm test
```

Sometimes you will want to delete some files for read-only permissions. The direct use of rm delete will show a prompt as follows:

![image desc7](https://labex.io/upload/T/V/T/iBhkTf9FXiro.jpeg)

If you want to ignore this prompt and delete the file directly. You can use the -f parameter to force the deletion:

```
$ rm -f test
```

#### 3.3.2 Delete directories

As with the copy directory, to delete a directory, you also need to add-r or-R parameter:s

```
$ rm -r family
```

### 3.4 Move files & rename files

#### 3.4.1 Move files

The command `mv` can move a file to another place. Move "file1" to the directory, named "Documents":

```
$ mkdir Documents
$ mv file1 Documents
```

![image desc8](https://labex.io/upload/F/M/C/QF3QFY7xH3ss.jpeg)



#### 3.4.2 Rename a file

Rename the file "file1" to "myfile":

```
$ mv file1 myfile
```

#### 3.4.3 Rename files

The command `mv` cannot rename multiple files. We can use the command `rename` to achieve, but it uses Perl regular expression as parameters. The regular expression will be introduced later.

```
# Create 5 files using wildcards:
$ touch file{1..5}.txt

$ rename 's/\.txt/\.c/' *.txt

$ rename 'y/a-z/A-Z/' *.c
```

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'rm' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "rm" cmd.
  timeout: 3
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'mv' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "mv" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```

### 3.5. View files

#### `cat`，`tac`  & `nl` 

The first two commands are used to print file content to standard output (terminal). While `cat` prints the contents in positive order, `tac`  prints the contents in reverse order.

> Standard input and output: When we execute a shell command, the system will automatically open three standard files. The standard input file (stdin), standard output file (stdout) and standard error output file (stderr) The process will get input data from the standard input file and output the data to the standard output file. If there is any error, the process would send the error message to the standard error file.

For example, we can view the file `passwd` which we copied from `/etc` :

```
$ cat passwd
```

You can add -n parameter to display line number:

```
$ cat -n passwd
```

![image desc9](https://labex.io/upload/L/E/R/py0h1HzcYejc.jpeg)

`nl` : add line number and print.

Descriptions for some parameters of `nl` ：

```
-b: Specify the logical page body lines to be numbered, Recognized type arguments are:
a       Number all lines.
t       Number only non-empty lines.
n       No line numbering.
The default type for logical page body lines is t.

-n: Specify the line numbering output format.
Recognized format arguments are:
ln      Left justified.
rn      Right justified, leading zeros suppressed.
rz      Right justified, leading zeros kept.
The default format is rn.

-w: Specify the number of characters to be occupied by the line number; in case the width is insufficient to hold the line number, it will be truncated to its width least significant digits. The default width is 6.

```

You need to use the mouse to drag the scroll bar or slide the scroll wheel to scroll down. You can use the following commands to use keyboard operating pages directly.

#### `more` and `less` 

`more` is relatively simple than `less`, which can only roll in one direction. `Less` is a program similar to `more`, but allows backward  movement in the file as well as forward movement.  Also, less does not have to read the entire input file before starting. So with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like `vi`.  `Less` uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a variety of terminals. There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals (on a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be printed at the top of the screen are prefixed with a caret). Commands are based on both more and vi. Commands may be preceded by a decimal number, called N in the descriptions below. The number is used by some commands, as indicated.

Use `more` to open the `passwd`:

```
$ more passwd
```
![image desc11](https://labex.io/upload/L/Y/P/ffi9xHWTCM1J.jpeg)

You can use `Enter` to scroll down one line, `Space` to scroll down one screen, `h` to display the help and `q` to exit.

#### Use `head` and `tail` to view the file

`head` displays the first count lines or bytes of each of the specified files, or of the standard input if no files are specified. If count is omitted, it defaults to 10. `tail` is similar to `head`. The difference is that `tail` displays the last count lines of files. For example, We want to view the information of new users, and as we all know, the new information must be at the end of the file. In this case, we can use `tail` to view it:

```
$ tail /etc/passwd
```

`tail` with the -n parameter can view the contents of a particular line in the file:

```
$ tail -n 1 /etc/passwd
```

![image desc12](https://labex.io/upload/H/V/U/2WjoVcMNwAnn.jpeg)

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'cat' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "cat" cmd.
  timeout: 3
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'head' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "head" cmd.
  timeout: 3
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'tail' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "tail" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```

### 3.6 View the file type

As we mentioned before, the type of file in Linux is not based on the file suffix. We need to use `file` to view the file type:

```
$ file /bin/ls
```

![image desc13](https://labex.io/upload/X/H/S/aciHDLax0XCf.jpeg)

This is an executable file that can run on a 64-bit platform and uses a dynamic link file (shared library).

### 3.7 Edit files

In Linux, we usually use command-line editors to edit files , such as (emacs, vim, nano). We have another course introducing `vim`. It is highly recommended that you first study the `vim` editor before continuing studying this course. If you want to expedite your learning progress, you can use the Linux internal vim tutorial, enter the following command to start:

```
$ vimtutor
```

## 4. Addition

**Time for Fun**

Do you believe you'll subconsicously feel pressured when learning? If someone is watching you, you must learn faster. Today, I'll teach you how to summon a pair of eyes to supervise you:

```
$ xeyes
```

You can use the following command to put it in the background to run:

```
$ nohup xeyes &
```
