## 2. History of Linux

Linux is an operating system, just like Windows (Win10, 7, 8) and Mac OS. 

The operating system began in the 1950s when OS was able to run the batch process. The batch program does not require interactions with users. It reads data from a file or punch card and then outputs it to another file or printer.

In the early 1960s, interactive operating systems became popular. It cannot only interact, but also make multiple users from different terminals operating the host at the same time. This kind of operating system is called a time-sharing operating system, and its emergence was a great challenge to the batch operating system. Many people tried to develop time-sharing operating systems, including both university research projects and business projects. At that time, a project called Multics was very innovative. However the development of the Multics project was not going well. It cost far more than expected, and did not occupy much of the market share in the operating system. When Bell Labs, part of the development group, withdrawn from the project, they developed an operating system - UNIX by themselves.

UNIX was originally released for free and was popular in college. Later, UNIX implemented the TCP / IP protocol stack, which became the first choice for early workstation operating systems.

In 1990, UNIX became the mainstream operating system in the server market. Most campuses had UNIX hosts. Unfortunately, since then, UNIX became commercialized and its price had become very expensive. The only substitute for UNIX was MINIX, which was a operating system with similar features and lower price. 

In October 1991, Linus Torvalds (the father of Linux) used UNIX at the University of Helsinki. He wanted to run a similar operating system on his own computer, but the commercial version of UNIX was very expensive, so he started with MINIX which was free. He aimed to develop a better operating system than MINIX. The first release version of his operation system quickly attracted some hackers. The first version of Linux was quite simple. However, as a lot of hackers tried to improve it, Linux gradually acquired many attractive features.

Linux is just a kernel of the operating system, which is the basis for other programs to run. It implements multi-tasking and hardware management. When the users or the system administrator run programs, those programs are actually running on top of the kernel. Some of these programs are required, for example, the command line interpreter (shell), which is used for interaction between users and writing shell scripts. Linux does not come with these applications but apply the existing free software. This reduces the amount of effort required to build a development environment. In fact, Linus Torvalds often rewrote the kernel, making it easier for those programs to run on Linux. Many important softwares, including the C compiler, came from the GNU project of the Free Software Fund. The GNU project began in 1984 with the aim of developing a completely free UNIX-like operating system. In recognition of GNU's contribution to Linux, many people call Linux GNU / Linux (GNU has its own kernel).

1992-1993, the Linux kernel has all the essential features of UNIX, including TCP / IP network, and graphical interface system (X window), hence Linux also attracted the attention of many industries. Some small companies began to develop and distribute Linux, with dozens of Linux user communities established. In 1994, Linux magazine began to issue.

Some of the breaking news of Linux are as follows:

- In 1965, Bell Labs, MIT, GE (General Electric) prepared to develop Multics system, in order to support 300 terminal access to the host, but they failed in 1969;

  > At that time, there is no mouse, keyboard and input device, only the card machine. Therefore, if you want to test a program, you need to insert a card reader paper into the card machine. If there is an error, you have to re-test; Multics: Multiplexed Information and Computing Service;

- In 1969, Ken Thompson (the father of C language) using the assembly language developed File Server System (Unics, that is, UNIX prototype);

  > Because of the dependency on hardware, assembly language can only target specific hardware;
  >
  > Just for transplanting a "space travel" game;

- In 1973, Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson invented the C language, and then wrote the UNIX kernel;

  > The B language was rewritten into C language; 90% of the codes are written in C language, 10% of the code written in assembly language, so when transplanting, only modify the 10% will suffice. 

- In 1977, Bill Joy of Berkeley University modified the UNIX source code for his machine, called BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution);

  > Bill Joy is the founder of Sun Microsystems；

- In 1979, UNIX released System V for personal computers;

- In 1984, because of the UNIX regulations, students cannot be provided with source code. Therefore for the purpose of teaching, Tanenbaum wrote their own Minix, compatible with UNIX;

- In 1984, Stallman started the GNU (GNU's Not Unix) project, and founded the FSF (Free Software Foundation) Foundation;

- In 1985, in order to protect free software produced by GNU from being patented by others, GPL (General Public License) copyright was created;

- In 1988, in order to develop GUI, MIT set up an organization to develop XFree86;

- In 1991, Linus Torvalds, a graduate student at the University of Helsinki, Finland, developed a Linux kernel for 386 machines based on gcc, bash;

- In 1994, Torvalds released Linux-v1.0;

- In 1996, Torvalds released Linux-v2.0, and determined the Linux mascot: penguins.

## 4. Desktop Environment
- Introduce to Linux Desktop Environment
- Use of Linux Desktop Environment
### 4.1 Introduction of Linux Desktop Environment

Compared to the current Windows system, UNIX / Linux itself has no graphical interface. The graphical interface we usually see in the distribution of UNIX / Linux is actually running on a Linux system software. Similar to the previous Windows graphical interface, was actually a set of software running in the DOS environment. The graphical interface software of Linux was XFree86, now it is xorg (X.Org).

This software is achieved through the X Window System (X Window System, also known as X11 or X). X itself is only a toolkit and architecture agreement, and xorg is a framework of the implementation of X. Xorg is a server that provides graphical interface services, just like Apache that provides web services. However, to achieve a complete desktop environment, a client is needed, called X Client. `LabEx` is using the XFCE desktop environment. Some users probably remember that the environment used before was LXDE. That means you can choose to install a different desktop environment on Linux, and even customize your own desktop.


![image desc](desktop.png)


At present, we mainly talk about the concept of Linux desktop environment and the differences between Linux and Windows operating system. In fact, there is a fundamental difference between them. We hope that you can ignore the operation differences between Windows and Linux and concentrate on the Linux system itself and the techniques you are learning in `LabEx`. This course and other courses are designed to help you achieve both of these goals.

### 4.2 The use of the Linux desktop environment

If you have any trouble dealing with the use of the current experimental desktop environment (xfce), it is recommendeded that you first study the introductory course of LabEx. 

## 5. Linux Terminal


We are not directly operating Linux system but through a process called Shell. In the figure below, in order to achieve in a window to complete the user input and display output, Linux system also provides a terminal simulator called the Terminal. Gnome-terminal, Kconsole, xterm, rxvt, kvt, nxterm and eterm are some of the most common terminal simulators. Our lab in the terminal program is xfce desktop environment with xfce-terminal. However, it should be noted that the terminal and the console are different.


![image desc](terminal.png)


In essence, the terminal is corresponding to the /dev/tty device on Linux. Linux multi-user function is done through /dev/tty device. Linux provides six default command line interface "terminal" ( 6 Virtual consoles) to allow users to log in. On the physical machine system you can switch by using `[Ctrl]` + `[Alt]` + `[F1] ~ [F6]`, but may not be able to switch in our online virtual environment because the special function keys will be hijacked by your host system. When you switch to one of the terminals and want to switch back to the graphical interface, you can press `[Ctrl]` + `[Alt]` + `[F7]` to complete.

In the graphical interface, the differences in user experience are not caused by the different versions of terminal simulator. Instead, Shell difference is the real reason. In addition to the shell, the system also contains UNIX / Linux kernel. Similar to the DOS command and cmd.exe., Shell is defined as "provided to the user interface" software. It is a program that accepts user input commands. It is called Shell because it hides details of the underlying operating system. The same UNIX / Linux graphical user interface GNOME and KDE, are sometimes called "virtual shell" or "graphical shell".

Shell of UNIX / Linux operating system is not only the user interaction interface but also a scripting language which can control system. This is also different from the Windows command line despite the fact that the  Windows command line also provides very simple control statements. In the Windows operating system, some users will never use the Shell. However, in the UNIX series operating system, Shell is a script interpreter program which can control system boot, X11 boot, and many other utilities.

In UNIX / Linux, some popular shells are bash, zsh, ksh, csh, and etc. Ubuntu terminal's default shell is bash and the default desktop environment is GNOME or Unity (based on GNOME), but our environment use zsh and xfce.

## 6. Input & output

In Linux, the most important thing is the command, which contains two processes: input and output.

In the figure, double-click the `Xfce Terminal` icon on the desktop to open the terminal, and then the system will automatically run the shell program. Finally, we can enter the command to let the system run:


![image desc](cmd.png)


### 6.1 Input  

Open the Xfce terminal, enter the command after `$`, and then press Enter.

```
#Create a empty file called "file“, touch is a command
$ touch file 

#Change the current directory, cd is a command
$ cd /etc/

#Print the current directory
$ pwd
```

### 6.2 output

The output will return the results you want. For example, if you want to see a file, it will return the contents of the file. When you fail, you can tell where it goes wrong. If successful, then there will be no output, because Linux's philosophy is: no result is the best result.


## 7. Shortcuts

Before you learn the command line, you must master or at least be familiar with a few very useful tips:

### 7.1 [Tab]


Use the `Tab` key to make up the command. When you forget the full name of a command, you can only enter the beginning of its part. Pressing the `Tab` key can help you complete:

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/G/L/A/LgIYkxwB1cmB.gif)



Of course, not only making up the command, but also making up the directory and making up the command parameters are feasible:

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/D/V/P/9DPBip3eA1KT.gif)


### 7.2 [Ctrl+c]

If the cursor on the screen is flashing but cannot continue to enter the command, or constantly produces a lot of outputs you do not want, how do we solve this issue? Or if you want to immediately stop and restore to your controllable state, then what shall we do? At this time, you can use `Ctrl + c` to force terminating the current program (it will not make the terminal exit).

Try entering the following command：

```
$ tail
```

Then you will find that your next input won't have any reaction. Now you can use `Ctrl + c` to interrupt the program. You might not know what the command is now, but in the follow-up lesson we will explain exactly what the `tail` command is.

Input the following command：

```
$ find /
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/T/G/D/g466X5w4rQrn.gif)


Obviously, this is not the result you want, you can use `Ctrl + c` to end it.

While this is very convenient, do not use `Ctrl+c` in every situation. Because sometimes when you see the terminal not responding, then probably the program might be taking some time to start. Therefore in this case, do not rush to press `Ctrl + c`.

### 7.3 Some other shortcuts

| Key             | function                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Ctrl+d`        | Keyboard input ends or exits the terminal                    |
| `Ctrl+s`        | Pause the current program and press any key to resume it     |
| `Ctrl+z`        | Put the current program in the background                    |
| `Ctrl+a`        | Move the cursor to the beginning of the input line, equivalent to `Home` |
| `Ctrl+e`        | Move the cursor to the end of the input line, equivalent to `End` |
| `Ctrl+k`        | Remove content from the the place the cursor is currently at to the end of the line |
| `Alt+Backspace` | Delete a word forward                                        |
| `Shift+PgUp`    | Scroll up the terminal                                       |
| `Shift+PgDn`    | Scroll down the terminal                                     |

### 7.4 Restore the commands used before

You can use the keyboard on the direction of the key `↑` to restore the commands you used before.

## 8. Wildcards


Wildcard is a special statement. Use * and ? to match the string (such as file name, and parameter name). When you find a folder, you can use it instead of one or more real characters; when you do not know the real characters, try to use wildcards instead of one or more actual characters.

The wildcard input in the terminal is handled by the shell, not by the program involved. It will only appear in the parameter value of command (it cannot appear in the command name). When the shell discovers a wildcard in the "parameter value", the shell searches for possible matches on the disk as a path or file name: if the match exists, it is replaced (path extension); Otherwise, The wildcard is passed as an ordinary character to the "command" and then processed by the command. In short, the wildcard is actually a kind of Shell implementation of the path extension function. After the wildcard is processed, the shell completes the reorganization of the command and then continues processing the reassigned command until the command is executed.

First, use command `touch` to create 2 files:

```
$ touch adsfasd.txt wergjlkas.txt
```

Name the files in any way you like. If you forgot the file names, and you want to find them, use wildcards：

```
$ ls *.txt
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/H/A/O/pBZsa1BAC612.jpeg)


When you are creating files, if you need to create multiple files at once, for example：**“love\_1\_linux.txt，love\_2\_linux.txt，... love\_10\_linux.txt”**. You can use the following command：

```
$ touch love_{1..10}_linux.txt
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/N/I/X/4YdmxwatYJjh.jpeg)


Common wildcards in Shell：

| character               | meaning                                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `*`                     | Match 0 or more characters                               |
| `?`                     | Match any character                                      |
| `[list]`                | Match any single character in the list                   |
| `[!list]`               | Match characters other than any single character in list |
| `[c1-c2]`               | Match any single character in c1-c2：[0-9][a-z]          |
| `{string1,string2,...}` | Match string1 or string2 (or more) with a string         |
| `{c1..c2}`              | Match all characters in c1-c2 such as {1..10}            |

## 9. Get Help

In Linux, if you encounter difficulties, you can use the `man` command which is the abbreviation of Manual pages.

Manual pages are a popular form of online software documentation for UNIX or UNIX-like operating systems, including computer programs (including libraries and system calls), formal standards and conventions, and even abstract concepts. The user can invoke the `man` page by executing the man command.

You can use the following way to get a description of a command:

```
$ man <command_name>
```

For example, if you want to see how the `man` command is used, you can type:

```
$ man man
```

The manual script contains a lot of content, involving all aspects of Linux. In order to facilitate the search, the man manual is divided into eight sections:

| Section | Description                                          |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | General order                                        |
| 2       | System call                                          |
| 3       | Library functions, covering the C standard library   |
| 4       | Special files (usually devices in / dev) and drivers |
| 5       | File format and convention                           |
| 6       | Games and screensavers                               |
| 7       | Others                                               |
| 8       | System management commands and daemons               |

To view the contents of the corresponding section, simply add the number of corresponding section after the man:

```
$ man 1 ls
```

All man pages follow a rule that is optimized for simple ASCII text presentations, and this does not have any form of highlighting or font control. Generally, they include the following:

**NAME**

> The name of the command or function.

**SYNOPSIS**

> For the command, the formal description of how it works, and what kind of command line parameters. For functions, introduce the parameters required for the function, and which header file contains the definition of the function.

**DESCRIPTION**

> Command or a description of the function.

**EXAMPLES**

> Some examples of usage.

**SEE ALSO**

> A list of related commands or functions.

There may also be other parts of the content. Common examples include: OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, ENVIRONMENT, BUGS, FILES, AUTHOR, REPORTING BUGS, HISTORY, and COPYRIGHT.

The man manual contains a lot of information. So your results might not be easily found. Fortunately, you can use Search in the man `/< keywords you want to search for> `. After the search, you can use `n`  switching to where the next keyword is. You can use `shift + n`  to locate where the previous keyword is. Use the `Space`  to scroll down and press `Enter` to scroll down one line.

If you want more help, you can also use the `info` command. But most of the time, man is enough. If you know the function of a command,  you want to see some of its specific parameters of the role. You can use -- help parameter. Most of the commands will have this parameter, such as:

```
$ ls --help
```


## 10. Homework


This Lab introduces an interesting Linux command. In this section, we introduce `banner` that can output graphic characters. Look at the effect:

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/P/F/H/0iA5wK15W3jm.jpeg)

You can use the following commands to install:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install sysvbanner
```

Then：

```
$ banner labex
```

If you think this font does not look cool, you can use an already installed command `printerbanner`：

```
$ printerbanner -w 50 A
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/T/E/F/twopszRGgP7r.jpeg)


The parameter `-w `specifies the print width. W must be added to the width limit because our environment displayed on the screen is relatively small. 

These two similar commands (`toilet`,`figlet`) are your homework.
