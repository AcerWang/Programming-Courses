## Analyze Historical Commands

### Introduction

In Linux, text processing and text analysis are extremely important. 

Now, there is a file called data1 and you can download the file here:

```
wget https://labexfile.oss-us-west-1-internal.aliyuncs.com/courses/1/data1
```

The file is a record of the use of some commands. Now you have to find the top 3 commands which are frequently shown in the file, and save it in `/home/labex/result`.

### Tasks

1. Processing text data
2. Write the result to`/home/labex/result`
3. Results include the number of times and commands, such as "100 ls"

### Tips

1. cut
2. uniq -dc
3. sort
4. The answer is similar to that
```
cat data|....|....|....   >  /home/labex/result
```
