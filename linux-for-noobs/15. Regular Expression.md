# Regular Expression

## 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Content

We will mainly introduce these three commands in this lab: `grep`, `sed`, `awk`. Regular expression is a way to use these three commands.

#### 1.2 Key Points

- `sed`
- `grep`
- `awk`
- Regular expression symbols and syntax

## 2. Regular Expression

What is a regular expression?

> **A regular expression**, **regex** or **regexp** is, in theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a sequence of characters that defines a *search pattern*. Usually, this pattern is then used by string searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings.

> Many programming languages support the use of regular expressions for string manipulation. For example, in Perl, it built a powerful regular expression engine.

In terms of form and function, regular expressions are similar to wildcards. However there is a big difference between them, especially in the meaning of some special matching characters. Hopefully you will not confuse these two.

### 2.1 Example

Suppose that we have a text file, including "labex", and "exlab" the two strings.

```
lab*
```

If it is a regular expression, it will only match lab. If \* is a wildcard, both strings (labex exlab) will be matched at the same time. Why? Because in regular expression, * indicates that the preceding sub-expression is matched (the character before it) zero or multiple times, such as it can match "lab", "labs", "labex", "exlab" , and as a wildcard, it indicates matching any wildcard followed by any number of arbitrary characters. So it can match "labex", and "exlab".

### 2.2 Basic syntax of regular expression

A regular expression is often referred to as a pattern that is used to describe or match a string that conforms to a syntactic rule.

#### What's `|` ？

`|` separates alternate possibilities. For example, "boy|girl" can match "boy" or "girl".

#### How to limit the number of matches？

- `+`  can match the preceding pattern element one or multiple times. For example, "goo + gle", can match "gooogle", "goooogle" and so on;
- `?`  can match the preceding pattern element zero or one time. For example, "colou? r" can match "color" or "colour";
- `*`  can match the preceding pattern element zero or multiple times. For example, "0 * 42" can match 42, 042, 0042, 00042 and so on.

#### Range and priority

`()` can be used to define the scope and priority of the pattern string, which can be simply understood as a string of parentheses as a whole. For example, "gr (a|e) y" is equivalent to "gray|gray".  "(grand)?father " can match father and grandfather.

#### Syntax

Regular expressions have many different styles. Here are some of the commonly used rules for regular expression matching for perl and python programming languages: 

> PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) is a regular expression library written in C by Philip Hazel. PCRE is a lightweight library of functions that is much smaller than the regular expression library like Boost. PCRE is very easy to use, while the function is also very powerful, performing better than the POSIX regular expression library and some classic regular expression libraries.

-  `\` :       **Mark the next character as a special character, or a literal character. **For example, "n" matches the character "n". "\n" matches a line break. "\\" matches "\" and "\\("matches" (". 
-  `^` :       **Match the start position of the input string.** 
-  `$` :      **Match the end position of the input string.** 
-  `{n}` :  n in {n, } is a non-negative integer that means **matching n times**. For example, "o {2}" cannot match "o" in "Bob", but it can match two o in "food". 
-  `{n,}` :    n in {n, } is a non-negative integer that means **matching at least n times**. For example, "o {2,}" cannot match "o" in "Bob", but it can match all "o" in "fooooood". 
-  `{n,m}` :   m and n are non-negative integers, where n <= m. It can match at least n times and match m times at most. For example, "o {1,3}" will match the first three o in "fooooood". "O {0,1}" is equivalent to "o?". Please note that there cannot be spaces between commas and two numbers. 
-  `*` :       **Match the previous subexpression zero or more times**. For example, "zo*" can match "z", "zo" and "zoo". * is equivalent to {0,}. 
-  `+` :      **Match the preceding subexpression one or more times.** For example, "zo+" can match "zo" and "zoo", but cannot match "z". "+" is equivalent to {1,}. 
-  `?` :       **Match the previous subexpression zero or once**. For example, "do (es)?" can match "do", "does". It is Equivalent to {0,1}. 
-  `?` :       This matching pattern is non-greedy when the character follows any other restraining character (*, +,?, {N}, {n,}, {n, m}). The non-greedy pattern matches the search string as little as possible, while the default greedy pattern matches as much as possible the matching string. For example, for the string "oooo", "o +?" will match a single "o", and "o +" will match all "o". 
-  `.` :       **Match any single character except "\n".** 
-  `(pattern)` : **Match the pattern and get the matching substring**. 
-  `x\y` : **Match x or y**. For example, "z\food" can match "z" or "food". "(Z\f)ood" matches "zood" or "food". 
-  `[xyz]` :   character class: **matching any of the characters contained in [ ]**. For example, "[abc]" can match "a" in "plain". Only `\` keeps special meaning. Other special characters such as `*`, `+` as ordinary characters. If `^` appears in the first place, it means a negative character set; if it appears in the middle of the string, it's only as a normal character. 
-  `[^xyz]` :  A negate character set. Match any character that is not listed. For example, "abc" can match "plin" in "plain". 
-  `[a-z]` : Match any character within the specified range. For example, "[a-z]" can match any lowercase alphabetic character in the range of "a" to "z". 
-  `[^a-z]` :  **Match any character that is not within the specified range**. For example, "a-z" can match any character that is not in the range of "a" to "z". 


#### The priority of operators

The priority is decreasing from top to bottom, from left to right:

- `\` : Escape character 
- `(), (?:), (?=), []` 
- `*,+,?,{n},{n,},{n,m}` : Restrictions 
- `^,$` : Location point
- `|` : The choice (also known as alternation or set union) operator matches either the expression before or the expression after the operator.

- [Regular_expression wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)

## 3. `grep`
- Arguments for grep
- Regular expression with grep
### 3.1 Operations

`gRep` is used to print the matching pattern string in the output text, which uses a regular expression as a condition for pattern matching. grep supports three regular expression engines respectively, with three parameters:

| Parameter | Description                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `-E`      | POSIX extended regular expression, ERE |
| `-G`      | POSIX basic regular expression, BRE    |
| `-P`      | Perl regular expression, PCRE          |

In most cases, you will only use ERE and BRE. So we will not discuss some of the regular expression syntax in PCRE.

Before using `grep` to use regular expressions, we first introduce some grep parameters:

| Parameters     | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-b`           | The offset in bytes of a matched pattern is displayed in front of the respective matched line. |
| `-c`           | Only a count of selected lines is written to standard output. |
| `-i`           | Ignore case                                                  |
| `-n`           | Displays the line number of the line where the matching text is located |
| `-v`           | Selected lines are those not matching any of the specified patterns. |
| `-r`           | Recursively search subdirectories listed.                    |
| `-A n`         | Print n lines of trailing context after each match.          |
| `-B n`         | Print n lines of leading context before each match.          |
| `--color=auto` | Mark up the matching text with the expression stored in GREP_COLOR environment variable. The possible values of when can be `never`,  `always`or `auto`. |

>  In most distributions, the color of grep is set by default. You can modify the GREP_COLOR environment variable by parameter.


### 3.2 Use regular expressions

#### Use POSIX basic regular expression

- Position match

Find the line that starts with "labex" in `/etc/group` :

```
$ grep 'labex' /etc/group
$ grep '^labex' /etc/group
```
![image desc3](https://labex.io/upload/U/D/R/t7zETQPSLpJY.jpeg)

- Restriction match

Match all strings that begin with 'z' and end with 'o'
```
$ echo 'zero\nzo\nzoo' | grep 'z.*o'
```
Match strings beginning with 'z', ending with 'o', with an arbitrary character in the middle.
```
$ echo 'zero\nzo\nzoo' | grep 'z.o'
```
Match strings that begins with 'z' and ends with any number of 'o'
```
$ echo 'zero\nzo\nzoo' | grep 'zo*'
```

**`\n` is the Line break**

![image desc4](https://labex.io/upload/M/A/J/MQai6U1YwCbG.jpeg)

- Choice match

By default, grep is case-sensitive. The command below will match all lowercase letters.
```
$ echo '1234\nabcd' | grep '[a-z]'
```
Match all the numbers
```
$ echo '1234\nabcd' | grep '[0-9]'
```
Match all the numbers
```
$ echo '1234\nabcd' | grep '[[:digit:]]'
```
Match all lowercase letters
```
$ echo '1234\nabcd' | grep '[[:lower:]]'
```
Match all uppercase letters
```
$ echo '1234\nabcd' | grep '[[:upper:]]'
```
Match all letters and numbers, including 0-9, a-z, A-Z
```
$ echo '1234\nabcd' | grep '[[:alnum:]]'
```
Match all the letters
```
$ echo '1234\nabcd' | grep '[[:alpha:]]'
```
![image desc5](https://labex.io/upload/L/G/D/SZLC6o5XJZBf.jpeg)

The following contains the complete special symbols and instructions:

| Special symbols | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `[:alnum:]`     | Upper and lower case letters and numbers (0-9, A-Z, a-z)     |
| `[:alpha:]`     | Any English uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z)       |
| `[:blank:]`     | Blank key and [Tab]                                          |
| `[:cntrl:]`     | Control buttons on the top of the keyboard, including CR, LF, Tab, Del .. and so on |
| `[:digit:]`     | Numbers(0-9)                                                 |
| `[:graph:]`     | All the keys except for black key and Tab                    |
| `[:lower:]`     | Lowercase letters(a-z)                                       |
| `[:print:]`     | Characters that can be printed out                           |
| `[:punct:]`     | punctuation symbols(" ' ? ! ; : # `$`⋯)                      |
| `[:upper:]`     | uppercase letters( A-Z)                                      |
| `[:space:]`     | Symbols include blank keys, [Tab], CR, and so on             |
| `[:xdigit:]`    | Hexadecimal number type, including: 0-9, A-F, a-f            |

> Note that the reason that [a-z] does not apply to all cases, which is also related to the value of the host set in the `LANG` environment variable. So we can use [:lower:] for all cases.

Exclude characters
```
$ echo 'geek\ngood' | grep '[^o]'
```

> Note that when `^` is placed in brackets, it means to exclude characters, otherwise `^` means the first line.

![image desc6](https://labex.io/upload/V/T/Q/edsVsjLi7ubB.jpeg)

#### Use POSIX extended regular expression

Using extended regular expression with grep requires adding the -E parameter, or using `egrep`.

- Restriction match

Only match "zo"
```
$ echo 'zero\nzo\nzoo' | grep -E 'zo{1}'
```
Matches all words beginning with "zo"
```
$ echo 'zero\nzo\nzoo' | grep -E 'zo{1,}'
```

- Choice match

Match "www.labex.io" and "www.google.com"
```
$ echo 'www.labex.io\nwww.baidu.com\nwww.google.com' | grep -E 'www\.(labex.io|google.com)'
```
Or match content that does not contain "baidu"
```
$ echo 'www.labex.io\nwww.baidu.com\nwww.google.com' | grep -Ev 'www\.baidu\.com'
```

> **Because `.` has a special meaning, so we need using `\.` to escape it.**

Next, we will introduce two more powerful tools `sed` and `awk`. Those two tools are so powerful that our content can not contain all of them. Here we will only introduce the basic content.
```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i '[.*]|\.|\*|\^' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use any regular expression.
  timeout: 3
```
## 4. `sed` 

`sed` is short for "stream editor for filtering and transforming text", meaning that the stream editor for filtering and converting text.

In Linux/UNIX, the editors are very powerful, such as "vi / vim (editor of God)", "emacs (God's editor)", "gedit". `sed` is unique in that it is a non-interactive editor. Here we begin introducing `sed`.

### 4.1 Commonly used parameters of `sed`

Format:

```
sed [Parameters]... [Command] [File]...
# For example：
$ sed -i '1s/sad/happy/' test
#Replace the "sad" in the first line of the test with "happy"
```

| Parameter     | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-n`          | By default, each line of input is echoed to the standard output after all of the commands have been applied to it. The -n option suppresses this behavior. |
| `-e`          | Append the editing commands specified by the command argument to the list of commands. |
| `-f filename` | Specify to execute the commands in the filename file.        |
| `-r`          | Use extended regular expressions, which default to standard regular expressions. |
| `-i`          | Directly modify the contents of the input file instead of printing to standard output. |

### 4.2 The execution command of `sed`

Format：

```
[n1],[n2]command
[n1]~[step]command
# Some of these commands can be added to the scope of the role, such as:
$ sed -i 's/sad/happy/g' test # g represents the global scope
$ sed -i 's/sad/happy/4' test # 4 represents the 4th matching string
```

`[n1],[n2]` means all lines from n1 to n2. `[n1]~[step` means all lines from n1 and the step size is `step` ; `command` means the execution command. Here are some commonly used execution commands:

| Command | Description                               |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `s`     | Replace the specified character in a line |
| `c`     | Change the selected line to the new text  |
| `a`     | Insert the text below the current line    |
| `i`     | Insert the text before the selected line  |
| `p`     | Print the row of the template block       |
| `d`     | Delete the selected row                   |

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'sed' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "sed" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 4.3 Operation example

First let's choose a text file for practice:

```
$ cp /etc/passwd ~
```

#### Then print the specified line

```
# Print 2-5 lines
$ nl passwd | sed -n '2,5p'
# Print odd lines
$ nl passwd | sed -n '1~2p'
```

![image desc7](https://labex.io/upload/H/K/P/mL3t00gixsUS.jpeg)

#### Replace the specified character in a line

```
# Replace "labex" in the input text globally with "hehe" and print the replacement line. Note that the last "p" command cannot be omitted here.
$ sed -n 's/labex/hehe/gp' passwd
```

#### Change the selected line to the new text

```
$ nl passwd | grep "labex"
# change line 21
$ sed -n '21c\www.labex.io' passwd
```

![image desc8](https://labex.io/upload/K/M/C/1RdK5vln2cKP.jpeg)

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'nl' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "nl" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```

## 5. `awk`

LabEx will release a series of more professional and in-depth “Linux system administrator learning” courses, which will cover `the regular expression`, `awk`, `sed` and other related topics systematically. Please look forward to it. Right now, the following content is an introductory tutorial on `awk`, which will introduce some common awk operations.

### 5.1 Introduction of wak

>AWK is an excellent text processing tool, one of the most powerful data processing engines available in Linux and Unix environments. Its name comes from its founder, Alfred Aho, Peter Jay Weinberger (Peter Weberger) and Brian Wilson Kernighan (Brian Colin), first letters of their last names. The three creators have officially defined AWK programming language as "style scanning and processing language". It allows you to create short programs that read input files, sort data, process data, perform calculations on input, and generate reports, as well as countless other functions. Most simply, AWK is a programming language tool for handling text.

In most Linux distributions, we are using gawk (awk GNU version). In our ubuntu environment, the default is mawk. But we can use `awk` (awk language interpreter), because the system has already created a symbolic link from mawk to awk for us.

```
$ ll /usr/bin/awk
```

![image desc9](https://labex.io/upload/C/Y/B/iEP1KCPtf3y5.jpeg)

>nawk: In the mid-1980s, the awk language was updated and replaced with an enhanced version called nawk (new awk). The old awk interpreter still exists in many systems, but it is usually installed as an oawk (old awk) command. And the nawk interpreter is installed as the main awk command, which can also use the nawk command. Dr. Kernighan is still in the maintenance of nawk, like gawk, it is also open source, and can be obtained free of charge.
>
>gawk is the open source implementation of the awk interpreter for GNU Project. Although the early GAWK release was an older AWK alternative, it was continually updated to include NAWK's features;
>
>mawk is also an interpreter for the awk programming language. The mawk follows the AWK language defined by POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) and contains some features that are not mentioned in the AWK manual. 

### 5.2 basic concepts of `awk`

All operations are based on the pattern-action statements, as in the following form:

```
$ pattern {action}
```

You can see that as with many programming languages, all the actions are in `{}`. `pattern` is usually a "relational" or "regular expression" that represents the text used to match the input, and `action` is the action that will be executed after the match. In a complete awk operation, you can only have one of them. If there is no `pattern`，the default is to match all the input text. If there is no `action`, the default is to print the matching content to the screen.

### 5.3 The basic format of `awk`

```
awk [-F fs] [-v var=value] [-f prog-file | 'program text'] [file...]
```

The parameter `-F` is used to pre-specify the field delimiter. `-v` used to specify variables for the awk program in advance. `-f` is used to specify the program file to be executed by the awk command. 

### 5.4 Operation experience

Create a new text document using `vim` :

```
$ vim test
```

The text should include the following content：

```
I like linux
www.labex.io
```

- Use `awk` to print the text :

```sh
$ awk '{
> print
> }' test
# Or just write a line
$ awk '{print}' test
```

![image desc10](https://labex.io/upload/O/V/X/2WTpXYd0lum6.jpeg)

**In this operation, I omit the pattern. So `awk` will match the entire contents of the input text by default**

- Each field of the first row of test is shown as a single line

```sh
$ awk '{
> if(NR==1){
> print $1 "\n" $2 "\n" $3
> } else {
> print}
> }' test

# or
$ awk '{
> if(NR==1){
> OFS="\n"
> print $1, $2, $3
> } else {
> print}
> }' test
```

![image desc11](https://labex.io/upload/X/E/E/B2ClcA3ZH0B7.jpeg)

Here, I use the branch selection statement `if`. The way to use `if` is similar with other high-level programming languages, such as C/C++, and Java. If you're equipped with the basic knowledge of these languages, you will have a great understanding of the codes. In addition, what you need to pay attention to is `NR` and `OFS`, these two are awk built-in variables. `NR` represents the number of rows currently being processed. `OFS` represents the field separator, and the default is a space. As shown in the above figure, we set the field delimiter to  `\n` (line breaks). `$N`, where N is the corresponding field number, is also awk's built-in variable. It indicates that the corresponding field is referenced. We have only three fields in the first line, hence only $1, $2, $3 are quoted. In addition, there is another $ 0 that does not appear here. It means referencing the entire contents of the current record (current line). 

- Change separator of the second line to a space

```sh
$ awk -F'.' '{
> if(NR==2){
> print $1 "\t" $2 "\t" $3
> }}' test

# or
$ awk '
> BEGIN{
> FS="."
> OFS="\t" 
> }{
> if(NR==2){
> print $1, $2, $3
> }}' test
```

![image desc12](https://labex.io/upload/F/B/X/ix8J3QSkipzP.jpeg)

**As a beginner, we should regard `awk` as a programming language. So we should try to enter more than one line, rather than all codes written in a single line.**

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'awk' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "awk" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 5.5  Some built-in variables

| Name       | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `FILENAME` | If there are multiple files, only the first one is valid. If the input is from standard input, it is NULL. |
| `$0`       | The contents of the current record                           |
| `$N`       | N represents the field number. The maximum value is the value of the NF variable |
| `FS`       | Field delimiter, represented by a regular expression, defaults to blank |
| `RS`       | Input record separator (default newline)                     |
| `NF`       | Number of fields in the current record                       |
| `NR`       | Ordinal number of the current record                         |
| `FNR`      | Ordinal number of the current record in the current file     |
| `OFS`      | Output field separator (default blank)                       |
| `ORS`      | Output record separator (default newline)                    |
