# Command Execution Sequence Control and Pipeline

## 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Content

In this lab, we'll describe how to execute commands sequentially and optionally, and we'll also introduce how to use `cut`, `grep`, `wc`, and `sort`. The flexibility of these commands will allow you to use Linux more efficiently.

#### 1.2 Key Points

- `cut`, `grep`, `wc`, `sort`
- Understand pipeline


## 2. Command Execution Sequence Control 
- Execute commands sequentially
- Execute commands optionally

### 2.1 Execute commands sequentially

In the previous lab, most of the time we're executing commands one by one. If you need to use `apt-get` to install a software, and run the installed software (or command tool) immediately, but your host has not updated the software list, then you may have the following series of operations:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install some-tool
$ some-tool
```

What we really want is being able to enter all the commands at once and let the commands execute by themselves in order.

You can use `;` to complete as follows:

```
$ sudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get install some-tool;some-tool
```

### 2.2 Execute commands optionally

There is a problem with the above operation. If the previous command is unsuccessful and the subsequent command is dependent on the result of the previous command, it will take a long time and eventually we might end up with a wrong result. So we need to be able to selectively execute the commands, such as the system will continue to the next command only after the success of the previous one. For example, we use `which` to find out whether to install a command. If you find it, the system will execute the command, otherwise it'll do nothing.

```
$ which cowsay>/dev/null && cowsay -f head-in ohch~
```

If you do not install `cowsay`, and you execute the above command, nothing will happen. But after you have installed it, and you execute the above command again, you will see some surprises.

`&&` is used to implement selective execution of the commands. It means that if the preceding command execution result returns a value of 0, the subsequent command is executed. Otherwise, the following command is not executed. You can get the result of the last command from the environment variable `$?`:

C language users should know that in C language, `&&` means logic AND and `||` means logical OR. The two symbols in Shell are not only used to represent logical AND, logical OR, but also to achieve simple control of the execution order of the commands:

```
$ which cowsay>/dev/null || echo "cowsay has not been install, please run 'sudo apt-get install cowsay' to install"
```

In addition to the basic use of the above, we can also combine `&&` and `||` to achieve some operations such as:

```
$ which cowsay>/dev/null && echo "exist" || echo "not exist"
```

### 2.3 Question

We talked about using `&&` and `||` together. For example, in the above command, `&&` is in the former and `||` is in the latter. If this order can be reversed, does the order of `&&` and `||` affect the execution result? 

## 3. Pipeline

What's pipeline?  

In [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) computer [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system), a pipeline is a sequence of [processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)) chained together by their [standard streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams), so that the output of each process (*stdout*) feeds directly as input (*stdin*) to the next one.

Pipes are divided into anonymous pipe and named pipe. When we use some filtering procedures, we use anonymous pipe. At the command line, the pipe is represented by `|`. In previous content, we have used it many times. A traditional pipe is unnamed and lasts only as long as the process does. A named pipe, however, can last as long as the system is up, beyond the life of the process. It can be deleted if it is no longer in use. Usually a named pipe appears as a file, and generally has processes attached for IPC.

### 3.1 First try

Now let's try the pipeline, i.e. viewing `/etc` directory. We use `ls` to view:

```
$ ls -al /etc
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/O/L/X/vTxIi8VbMgRO.png)

Because there is too much content, the screen cannot be displayed completely. This time you can use the scroll bar or shortcut keys to scroll through the window to view. But you can also use the pipeline:

```
$ ls -al /etc | less
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/O/J/G/yp68nRJQVvWs.png)

The output of the previous command (ls) is used as the input of the next command (less), and then we can view the outputs line by line.

### 3.2 `cut` - print some fields for each row

Print the first field and the sixth field of each row in`/etc/passwd`. The fields are seperated by `:`.  The first field and the sixth field represent the username and its home directory respectively:

```
$ cut /etc/passwd -d ':' -f 1,6
```

![image desc4](https://labex.io/upload/H/B/L/Nui4XpHfFNb6.jpeg)

Print the first N characters of each line in the `/etc/passwd` :

the first 5 characters(including the fifth)
```
$ cut /etc/passwd -c -5
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/S/P/X/d0hqyLCJgR4z.png)

After the first five(including the fifth)
```
$ cut /etc/passwd -c 5-
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/J/V/F/EMyGg3bWVW2Q.png)

the fifth
```
$ cut /etc/passwd -c 5
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/Y/E/H/pxlmiE82McPG.png)

Between 2 and 5 (including the fifth)
```
$ cut /etc/passwd -c 2-5
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/S/T/Q/FlV4cZtUntvw.png)

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'cut' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "cut" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 3.3 `grep` - search a matching string in text or stdin

`grep` is very powerful. It combines regular expressions to achieve very complex but very efficient matching and search functions. But before learning the regular expression, let's look at a brief introduction first.

The general form of `grep` isï¼š

```
grep [options]... The expression used to match [file]...
```

We search all the text files containing "labex" in the `/home/labex` directory and display the line number:

```
$ grep -rnI "labex" ~
```
![image desc5](https://labex.io/upload/N/W/P/crOXOiou8UfV.jpeg)


The `-r` parameter indicates recursively searching the file in all subdirectories. `-I` Indicates that binary files are ignored. 

Of course, we can also use the regular expression in the matching field:

View the string in the environment variable ending with "abe"
```
$ export | grep ".*bex$"
```

![image desc6](https://labex.io/upload/E/F/I/5L9pFq0dk18y.jpeg)

 `$` means the end of a line.

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'grep' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "grep" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 3.4 `wc` - a simple and compact counting tool

`wc` is used to count and output the number of lines, words, and bytes in a file:

```
$ wc /etc/passwd
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/Q/W/L/e48mv03avWTT.png)

We respectively output the number of lines, the number of words, the number of bytes, the number of characters and the longest line of bytes:

number of lines
```
$ wc -l /etc/passwd
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/J/D/K/1gsR8IxUMaws.png)

the number of words
```
$ wc -w /etc/passwd
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/B/Q/L/iByu01iehTsx.png)

the number of bytes
```
wc -c /etc/passwd
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/O/D/Q/Abm49NCtbTD5.png)

the number of characters
```
$ wc -m /etc/passwd
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/G/M/O/oZ35ta2LptsX.png)

the longest line of bytes
```
$ wc -L /etc/passwd
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/N/Y/F/9UJozhxirZnN.png)


Then we count the number of folders in `/etc`:

```
$ ls -dl /etc/*/ | wc -l
```

![image desc8](https://labex.io/upload/A/D/W/jxIlY73iZid4.jpeg)

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'wc' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "wc" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 3.5 `sort`

This command can sort the input in a certain way. It supports sorting by dictionary, number, month, by random, and reverse sort. It can also specify specific fields for sorting, and so on.

Default for dictionary order:

```
$ cat /etc/passswd | sort
```

Reverse Sort:

```
$ cat /etc/passwd | sort -r
```

Sort by specific fields:

```
$ cat /etc/passwd | sort -t':' -k 3
```

`-t` is used to specify a delimiter. Here we use ":" as a delimiter;`-k n` is used to specify which field to sort.

The third field in `/etc/passwd` is a number. We use the parameter `-n` for numeric sorting.

```
$ cat /etc/passwd | sort -t':' -k 3 -n
```

![image desc9](https://labex.io/upload/Y/A/K/quTc9x6AY4mo.jpeg)

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'sort' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "sort" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```

### 3.6 `uniq`

This command can be used to filter duplicate rows or output duplicate rows.

- Filter duplicate rows

We can use `history` to view the executed commands, but we just want to see which commands are used. So we should remove the arguments from the commands and remove the duplicate commands:

```
$ history | cut -c 8- | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | uniq
```

However, **`uniq` can only remove the same successive commands. It cannot remove duplicate commands if they are not adjacent. **So if we want to remove all duplicate commands, we should sort all the commands first:

```
$ history | cut -c 8- | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | sort | uniq
```
or 
```
$ history | cut -c 8- | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | sort -u
```

- Output repeating rows:

Output repeats and the number of repetitions
```
$ history | cut -c 8- | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | sort | uniq -dc
```
Output all repeats
```
$ history | cut -c 8- | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | sort | uniq -D
```

There are many text processing commands. In the next section, we will continue to introduce some commonly used text processing commands.

#### Have fun!

Please install `aview` and `imagemagick`. Then use the `asciiview` command to display the image. You can use `man` to know how to use this command.

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'uniq' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "uniq" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```

## 4. Homework

Try to use `cut`, `sort`, `uniq` with different parameters.
