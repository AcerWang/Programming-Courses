# Data Stream Redirection

## 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Content

You may not be familiar with the concept of redirection, but you should have seen `>` or `>>` operation in previous labs, and know that they are the standard outputs to a file or added to a file. As a matter of fact, this is redirection. The original output to the standard output is redirected to a file. Because the standard output (`/dev/stdout`) is a file, there is no problem that we redirect the output to another file.

#### 1.2 Key Points

- How to use redirection
- File descriptor (0,1,2)

## 2. Data stream redirection

Let's take a brief look at the two redirection operations we used earlier:

```
$ echo 'hello labex' > redirect 
$ echo 'www.labex.io' >> redirect
$ cat redirect
```

> You can also try "echo 'hello labex' < redirect". The difference between `<, <<` and `>, >>` is redirect direction.  `>, >>` means the direction is from left to right. And `<, <<` means the direction is from right to left.

### 2.1 Simple Use of Redirection

Before we learn more about Linux redirection, we need to know some basic concepts. As we mentioned earlier, Linux provides three special devices for terminal display and output, which are stdin (standard input, corresponding at your input at the terminal), stdout (standard output, corresponding to the output of the terminal), and stderr (standard error output, corresponding to the output of the terminal).

| File descriptor | Device file   | Description |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| `0`             | `/dev/stdin`  | stdin       |
| `1`             | `/dev/stdout` | stdout      |
| `2`             | `/dev/stderr` | stderr      |

> File descriptor: a file descriptor (FD, less frequently fildes) is an abstract indicator (handle) used to access a file or other input/output resource, such as a pipe or network socket. File descriptors form part of the POSIX application programming interface. A file descriptor is a non-negative integer, generally represented in the C programming language as the type int (negative values being reserved to indicate "no value" or an error condition).

We can use these file descriptors like this:

By default, the system uses standard input as the command input and the standard output as the command output.
```
$ cat 
（Press Ctrl+C to exit）
```

We redirect the output of `cat` to a file:

```
$ mkdir Documents
$ cat > Documents/test.c <<EOF
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("hello world\n");
    return 0;
}

EOF
```

We put a file as a command input, the standard output as a command output:

```
$ cat Documents/test.c
```

Then, we use the data passed through pipeline as the input of `cat` and use the standard output as a command output.

```
$ echo 'hi' | cat
```

The output of the `echo` command is redirected from the standard output to a normal file

```
$ echo 'hello labex' > redirect
$ cat redirect
```

### 2.2 `stderr` Redirection

Redirect the standard output to a file, which is a very practical operation. Another practical operation is to redirect the standard error. Both the standard output and the standard error are directed to the screen display. So the output of the command we often see is usually included in the standard output and standard error results, such as the following:

Use the cat command to read two files at the same time, one of which exists and the other does not exist
```
$ cat Documents/test.c hello.c
```
Command not only output the contents of the first file, but also at the end of an error message
Then, we redirect the output to a file. According to our previous experience, we cannot see any output
```
$ cat Documents/test.c hello.c > somefile
```

Unfortunately, although we redirect the output to the file, there is still the error message. Sometimes，we want to hide some errors or warnings, then what should we do? We can use the file descriptor to achieve that:

Redirect the standard error to the standard output, and then redirect the standard output to the file.
```
$ cat Documents/test.c hello.c >somefile  2>&1
```
Or use the special redirection symbol "&" provided by bash to redirect standard and standard output to the file at the same time
```
$ cat Documents/test.c hello.c &>somefile
```

**Note that you should add `&` before the output redirect file descriptor, otherwise the shell will be redirected to a file named 1.**

### 2.3 `tee`

Sometimes, in addition to redirecting the output to a file, we also need to print the information at the terminal. Then you can use the `tee` command:

```
$ echo 'hello labex' | tee hello
```

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'tee' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "tee" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.4 Permanent redirection

Redirect operations were temporary, which means that the redirection is only valid for the current command. We can use `exec` to implement a permanent redirect. 
```
# Open a sub-shell
$ zsh

# Use exec to redirect the standard output to a file
$ exec 1>somefile

# The output of the command you execute later will be redirected to the file until you exit the current shell, or cancel the exec's redirect (later we will tell you how to operate)
$ ls
$ exit
$ cat somefile
```

### 2.5 Create a file descriptor

There are 9 file descriptors in the Shell. We used the `0`,`1`,`2` file descriptor before. We can also use the 3-8 file descriptors, but they are not open by default. You can use the following command to view the file descriptors that are open in the current shell process:

```
$ cd /dev/fd/;ls -Al
```

`exec` can also create a new file descriptor:

```
$ zsh
$ exec 3>somefile
$ cd /dev/fd/;ls -Al;cd -
# Note that there should be no space between > and &. If there is a space, result will be wrong.
$ echo "this is test" >&3
$ cat somefile
$ exit
```

### 2.6 Close a file descriptor

You can use the following operation to turn off `3` file descriptor:

```
$ exec 3>&-
$ cd /dev/fd;ls -Al;cd -
```

### 2.7 Drop the output of a command

There is a device file called "black hole" in Linux, so the data will be swallowed.

> On UNIX-like systems, `/dev/null` is a special device file that is typically used to drop unwanted output streams or as empty files for input streams, which are usually done by redirecting. Reading it will get an EOF.

We can use `/dev/null` to mask command output:

```
$ cat Documents/test.c nefile 1>/dev/null 2>&1
```

Thus the output cannot be obtained.

### 2.8 Use `xargs` to split the parameter list

> `xargs` is a common command for UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems. Its role is to convert the parameter list into small pieces of segmentation passed to other commands to avoid the problem that the parameter list is too long.

This command is useful, especially when dealing with commands that produce large amount of outputs, such as `find`, `locate`, and `grep`. Please refer to `man` for detailed information.

```
$ cut -d: -f1 < /etc/passwd | sort | xargs echo
```

![image desc](https://labex.io//upload/I/I/M/SQxJhEWGG3Kj.png)

The above command is used to sort the `/etc/passwd` file with the first field which is spilted by `:` and use `echo` to generate a list.

#### Have fun!

Previously, we introduced `aview/asciiview` which can convert picture to ascii characters, but it is black and white. The following tool can display color pictures：

```
$ sudo apt-get install caca-utils
$ cacaview <pic_file>
$ cacademo
$ cacafire
```

## 3. Homework

1. Understand the following code. This code does not work properly. Please use what you learned in this section to analyze the underlying reason and try to solve this problem.

```shell
while read filename; do
  rm -iv $filename
done <<(ls)
