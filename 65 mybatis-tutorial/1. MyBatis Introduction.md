# MyBatis Introduction

## 1. Introduction

This tutorial will introduce MyBatis about its architecture, functionality and usage.

#### Learning Objective

- MyBatis concept
- MyBatis architecture

## 2. Content

- Introduction for MyBatis
- MyBatis Architecture
- MyBatis Framework

###2.1 What's MyBatis?

There is a concept called  ORM. ORM is short for Object Relational Mapping. It is a tool for mapping an object in OOP language to database entity. It simplify operation to database by means of handling an object.

The relationship of ORM:

- A data table corresponds to a class
- A row in table corresponds to an object
- A field in row corresponds to an attribute of an object.

MyBatis is an excellent persistence framework supporting customized SQL statements, stored procedure and advanced mapping. MyBatis keeps you away from writing JDBC code and setting params manually. MyBatis is based on xml configuration file and annotation. It aims at reducing SQL statements in program and configuring them in configuration file. It provides more flexibility.

MyBatis is not  totally an ORM framework, it enables SQL statements. You can regard it as a semi-automatic ORM implementation.

### 2.2 Architecture

Bellow is the architecture of MyBatis.

- API Layer: Provide interfaces to outside, invoke data processing methods. Developers operate database using these interfaces.
- Data Processing Layer: Be used for SQL search, SQL resolve, SQL execution and result set mapping
- Support Layer: Provide common functionality such as connection management, transaction management, configuration management and cache. It's the fundation of framework.

### 2.3 Framework Structure

- Load configuration file:  MyBatis will configure context according to xml configuration file, creating `SqlSessionFactory`. `SqlSessionFactory` gets information from configuration file and annotation, creates MappedStatement objects in memory.
- SQL resolving: When receiving invoke request, MyBatis will find MappedStatement according to received SQL and object. MappedStatement will perform resolving and get final SQL statement and parameters.
- SQL execution: `SqlSession` executes the resolved SQL statement and parameters and get result.
- Result mapping: Mapping the result to HashMap, JavaBean or other basic data types, return result and close SqlSession.

#### 2.3.1 SqlSessionFactory

Each MyBatis application has a `SqlSessionFactory` as the core. `SqlSessionFactory` is a compiled database mapping object. It can be created by `SqlSessionFactoryBuilder`. `SqlSessionFactoryBuilder` comes from xml configuration file or `Configuration` instance. `SqlSessionFactory` creates `SqlSession`.

####2.3.2 SqlSession

`SqlSession` object performs data persistence. It contains all methods needed to execute SQL statements. It  can directly execute Mapped statement. Remember to close `SqlSession` at the end.

### 2.4 Advantages

1. Simple and easy.
2. Seperate SQL statement from program.
3. Provide annotation, support object mapping to database fields.
4. Provide xml tags, support dynamic SQL statements.

## 3. Summary

In this section, we only introduced some concepts. But they are import for understanding MyBatis underlying principle.
