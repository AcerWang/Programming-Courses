# Basic about Memory Pool

## 1. Introduction

The memory allocated to the memory pool is faster than the memory allocated to it from the heap. A long-term, stable-running memory allocation service is necessary in many situations. Similar to the default allocator in the standard library, the memory pool is essentially a distributor. This project will design and use C++ to implement a high-performance memory pool.

#### Things to Learn

- C++ allocator `std::allocator`
- Memory pool technology
- Manually implement chain stack template

### 2.1 Memory Pool

Memory pools are a form of pooling technology. Normally, when we write a program, we use the `new` `delete` keyword to apply for memory to the operating system. The consequence of this is that every time we apply for memory and release memory, we need to deal with operating system system calls. , allocate the required memory from the heap. If such an operation is too frequent, a large amount of memory fragmentation will be found to reduce the memory allocation performance and even memory allocation failure.

The memory pool is a technology that is created to solve this problem. From the concept of memory allocation, the memory application is nothing more than asking for a pointer to the memory allocator. When applying memory to the operating system, the operating system needs to perform complex memory management scheduling before it can properly allocate a corresponding pointer. In the process of this distribution, we also face the risk of failure in distribution.

Therefore, every time when the memory is allocated, it will consume the time for allocating memory. If this time is set to T, then the total time spent on allocating n times is nT; if we determine at the beginning how much memory we may need, then The initial allocation of such a memory area, when we need memory, directly from the allocated memory can be used, then the total allocation time required is only T. Larger n we have, more time we economized.

### 2.2 Designing Main Function

We must design and implement a high-performance memory pool, then naturally we can not avoid the need to compare existing memory, and compare the performance of the memory pool memory allocation, you need to implement a structure that requires dynamic allocation of memory (for example: linked list stack) For this purpose, we can write the following code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>
#include <ctime>
#include <vector>

//#include "MemoryPool.hpp"
#include "StackAlloc.hpp"

// modify according to computer performance
// number of insert elements
#define ELEMS 25000
// repeted times
#define REPS 5000

int main()
{
    clock_t start;

    // use default allocation
    StackAlloc<int, std::allocator<int> > stackDefault;
    start = clock();
    for (int j = 0; j < REPS; j++) {
        assert(stackDefault.empty());
        for (int i = 0; i < ELEMS; i++)
          stackDefault.push(i);
        for (int i = 0; i < ELEMS; i++)
          stackDefault.pop();
    }
    std::cout << "Default Allocator Time: ";
    std::cout << (((double)clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC) << "\n\n";

    // use memory pool
    StackAlloc<int, MemoryPool<int> > stackPool;
    start = clock();
    for (int j = 0; j < REPS; j++) {
        assert(stackPool.empty());
        for (int i = 0; i < ELEMS; i++)
          stackPool.push(i);
        for (int i = 0; i < ELEMS; i++)
          stackPool.pop();
    }
    std::cout << "MemoryPool Allocator Time: ";
    std::cout << (((double)clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC) << "\n\n";

    return 0;
}
```

In the above pieces of code, `StackAlloc` is a linked list stack that accepts two template parameters. The first parameter is the element type in the stack, and the second parameter is the memory allocator used by the stack.

Therefore, the template parameter of this memory allocator is the only variable in the entire comparison process. The template parameter of the default allocator is `std::allocator<int>`, and the template parameter of the memory pool is `MemoryPool<int>` .

> `std::allocator` is the default allocator provided in the C++ standard library. Its characteristic lies in that when we use new to apply memory to construct new objects, it is necessary to call the default constructor of the class object, and use `std::allocator` You can separate the two parts of memory allocation and object construction logic, so that the allocated memory is original and unstructured.

Let's implement the linked list stack.

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/Code/main.cpp
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "main.cpp" in /home/labex/Code!
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.3 Linked List Stack Template

The structure of the stack is very simple, there is no complicated logic operation, and its member functions only need to consider two basic operations: stacking and popping. For the convenience of operation, we may also need some methods: determine whether the stack is empty, empty the stack, and get the top element of the stack.

```cpp
// StackAlloc.hpp
#ifndef STACK_ALLOC_HPP
#define STACK_ALLOC_HPP

#include <memory>

template <typename T>
struct StackNode_
{
  T data;
  StackNode_* prev;
};

// T indicates object type, Alloc is allocator
// use std::allocator as default allocator
template <class T, class Alloc = std::allocator<T> >
class StackAlloc
{
  public:
    // use typedef simplify name
    typedef StackNode_<T> Node;
    typedef typename Alloc::template rebind<Node>::other allocator;

    // default constructor
    StackAlloc() { head_ = 0; }
    // default deconstructor
    ~StackAlloc() { clear(); }

    // return true if stack empty
    bool empty() {return (head_ == 0);}

    // release all memory in stack
    void clear();

    void push(T element);

    T pop();

    // return top element of stack
    T top() { return (head_->data); }

  private:
    allocator allocator_;
    Node* head_;
};

#endif // STACK_ALLOC_HPP
```

You may ask what is the meaning of `typedef typename Alloc::template rebind<Node>::other allocator`, this is a very good question, because this style of writing is rare.

First of all, we absolutely defined something to be `allocator` by `typedef`, however, we wrote the code like that way is all because of we want to help compiler recognize the meaning of the code.

Specifically, we defined `Alloc = std::allocator<T>`, and then `rebind` is actually a member of `std::allocator`. However, `rebind` is another template, namely dependent name. Thus, the complete form should be:

```cpp
std::allocator<T>::rebind<Node>::other
```

As you can see, `<T>` has already appeared in the first place, the `<Node>` must be interpreted to `<` operator of less, this will causes compiler error. Then we must write it as follows:

```cpp
std::allocator<T>::template rebind<Node>::other
```

Moreover, there is a constrains in the above writing style. The compiler doesn't know whether `other` is a type or a memeber. According to [here](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/memory/allocator/), we know that `other` is a type. Thus, `typename` is responsible for indicates the entire code is a type instead of `member`:

```cpp
typename std::allocator<T>::template rebind<Node>::other
```

Simple logic such as constructing, destructuring, judging whether the stack is empty or not, and returning the logic of the top element of the stack are very simple and implemented directly in the above definition. Now let's implement `clear()`, `push()` and ` Pop()` These three important logics:

```cpp
// release all memory in stack
void clear() {
    Node* curr = head_;
    while (curr != 0)
    {
    Node* tmp = curr->prev;
    allocator_.destroy(curr);
    allocator_.deallocate(curr, 1);
    curr = tmp;
    }
    head_ = 0;
}

void push(T element) {
    // allocate a node
    Node* newNode = allocator_.allocate(1);
    // call constructor
    allocator_.construct(newNode, Node());

    // push operation
    newNode->data = element;
    newNode->prev = head_;
    head_ = newNode;
}
T pop() {
    T result = head_->data;
    Node* tmp = head_->prev;
    allocator_.destroy(head_);
    allocator_.deallocate(head_, 1);
    head_ = tmp;
    return result;
}
```

At this point, we have completed the entire template linked list stack, and now we can first comment out the use of memory pool part of the `main()` function to test the memory allocation of the continuous table stack, we can get this result:
