## 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 The Background Knowledge Needed

- Basic syntax knowledge of C++  

#### 1.2 The Knowledge to Consolidate and Use

- OOP Programing
- Theory of function `std::rand()`
- Queuing theory
- Data structure of chained queue and implementing its template 
- Design of event-driven 
- Monte Carlo method
- Model of CPU resource competition
- Round Robin Scheduling


## 2. Theory
In the two experiments before, we've implemented a bank queue system. Now in this experiment, we will extend the code further, so as to simulate the competition of resource in CPU.

### 2.1 Problems to Be Solved

Every core of CPU is like an opened service window in the bank. So, we can easily change the bank queue system model a little bit to model the competition:


![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/B/I/A/9h18lhZadz03.png)

In the competition of the resource in CPU, the scheduling model above is simplified. In this process, we didn't enable the CPU with preemptive schedule, thus making every process have to wait for the tasks in the front of the queue to be scheduled, and it can only be scheduled after that. 

> As the thread scheduling of CPU won't stop before the outage, we need to set a service time of CPU(the service of bank) to stop the program from running. 

### 2.2 Round Robin Scheduling

The basic idea of Round Robin Scheduling is actually quite simple. The system would preliminarily set a time slice const, making sure that every service in the process has some time duration. When a new process arrives, it will be appended to the scheduled queue. The CPU has multiple cores, and each core serves for a time slice for a process. If the service is finished, then the process will be destroyed. Else, when the time slice ends, the process should be appended to the queue again. 

### 2.3 The Logics to Rewrote(Wrong Logics)

Comparing to the bank queues system before, from the surface of the logic, the logics of the whole queue system haven't be changed, except for the logic of departure event:

1. Every window in the bank queue system will be in service until the customer is finished. 
2. But withe the Round Robin scheduling of CPU resource, a process will only be served for one time slice. Once the time slice is over, the process will be inserted to the tail of the queue again.

So, the codes we need to rewite is the logic of `customerDeparture()` in `QueueSystem.cpp`:

1. If the occuring time of the departure event is longer than the total service time, then nothing needs to be done. 
2. The total staying time  += A time slice  
3. If the process duration of the current service is less than the time slice, destroy it at once. 
4. If the process duration of the current service is longer than the time slice, then minus the time slice in duration and insert it into the queue again. 
5. If there's a process in the queue waiting to be scheduled, then it should be served at once. 
6. If there's no processes at all, then set the current CPU core as available. 

Now, the `customerDeparture()` becomesd


```c++
// QueueSystem.cpp

#define TIME_SEGMENT 10

// Deak with the schedule event when the process ends 
void QueueSystem::customerDeparture() {
    // If the the occuring time of the departure event is longer than the service event, then we need to do nothing.  
    if (current_event->occur_time < total_service_time) {
        
        // The staying time += time slice 
        total_customer_stay_time += TIME_SEGMENT;
        
        // If the duration of the current customer < slice，then his/her service is finished.
        // Destroy it directly, or it will be the current customer and inserte back to the queue. 
        // Meanwhile, we need  to create a new event to insert to the event list.
        // The occuring time is the occuring time of the customer in the queue tail + time slice  
        if (windows[current_event->event_type].getCustomerDuration() > TIME_SEGMENT) {
            
            // Insert the new event to the event list 
            Event temp_event(
                customer_list.getLastCustomer()->arrive_time
                +TIME_SEGMENT);
            event_list.enqueue(temp_event);
            
            // Reinsert the current customer to the queue 
            Customer customer(customer_list.getLastCustomer()->arrive_time+TIME_SEGMENT, windows[current_event->event_type].getCustomerDuration() - TIME_SEGMENT);
            customer_list.enqueue(customer);
        }
        
        // If someone waits in the queue, get him/her served. 
        if (customer_list.length()) {
            Customer *customer;
            customer = customer_list.dequeue();
            windows[current_event->event_type].serveCustomer(*customer);
            
            // departure event
            Event temp_event(
                             current_event->occur_time + customer->duration,
                             current_event->event_type
                             );
            event_list.orderEnqueue(temp_event);
            
            delete customer;
        } else {
            // If there's noone in the queue, and the customer in the current window leaves, then the window is available 
            windows[current_event->event_type].setIdle();
        }
        
    }
}
```

We've added a method to get the element in the queue tail 

```CPP
// Queue.hpp

T* &getLastCustomer() {
        return this->rear;
}
```

In these codes, the only codes edited by us are:

```c++
// Staying time += time slice
total_customer_stay_time += TIME_SEGMENT;
    
        // If the duration of the current customer < slice，then his/her service is finished.
        // Destroy it directly, or it will be the current customer and inserte back to the queue. 
        // Meanwhile, we need  to create a new event to insert to the event list.
        // The occuring time is the occuring time of the customer in the queue tail + time slice  
if (windows[current_event->event_type].getCustomerDuration() > TIME_SEGMENT) {
    
    // Insert the new event to the event list 
    Event temp_event(
        customer_list.getLastCustomer()->arrive_time
        +TIME_SEGMENT);
    event_list.enqueue(temp_event);
    
    // Insert the current customer back to the queue 
    Customer customer(customer_list.getLastCustomer()->arrive_time+TIME_SEGMENT, 
                      windows[current_event->event_type].getCustomerDuration() - TIME_SEGMENT);
            customer_list.enqueue(customer);
}
```

NoW let's set the time slice as 10, which means, the round-robin scheduling will be finished in every 10 minutes. Operate the whole codes again, here's what we will find:

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/Y/Y/H/eIODzQMwKckn.png)

1. Every process stays in the CPU for average 0.9 minute. 
2. 1.42 customers arrives per minute. 

**Note that it's a wrong result.** So if you think it's finished, then you didn't think carefully enough. 


### 2.4  The Correct Logic 

Every time we process the arriving event, we add one on the total customers number. As a matter of fact, many customers are the customers who didn't finish their servic before. This is the bug of our logic. To solve the problem, the initializing logic of the queue and the arriving logic of the process all should be rewrotten. 

**The process logic of arriving event `customerArrived`**

As for arriving event, it might be the new process, or an old one(so we can set -1 for new and -2 for old in event_type):

1. If it's new, create a new process and insert to the queue. 
2. If it's old, insert a former process in the queue. 

Now, every event should have an id property. If the property is 0, that means the event is set for the new process. Else, the id should be used to index the former process.  

But here we are at a new question: Where can we index the former process? So we need to append a cache in `QueueSystem`, to save the process that has been left but still should be added to the queue to be scheduled.

Then we can get the process to be served in the `buffer` while implementing this part of logic. 

So the idea of rewriting `customerArrived` is:

1. According to the type of the arriving event to decide whether a new process should be created; 
2. If it's a new process, insert it into the queue; 
3. If it's an old process, then we shuold get the process that should've been arrived from the cache and insert it to the queue. 
4. If the id of the current process is bigger than the process we served, then it's an old one. The total number shouldn't be inreased. 
5. Create the arriving event of the next customer. And insert the arriving event and the customer both into the the queue. Or just serve the current customer. 
6. If there's an available window, serve the customer at once, and append a departure event. The occuring event of the departure event, is the current time pluse the time slice. Else, do nothing. 

**The process logic of the departure event `customerDeparture`**

The logic of the departure event has barely changed. However, to make it compare with the id in the cache, we also need to append an id property to the process nodes, with nothing changed in other baisc logics: 

1. If the occuring time of the departure event is longer than the total service time, then nothing has to be done. 
2. The staying time of the total process += time slice.
3. If the duration of the current process < time slice, then destroy it directly.
4. If the duration of the current process > time slice, then duration -= time slice. And insert the duration into the cache. Next, the index id of the cache should be set as the process id, enabling the arriving event to be processed; And for the departure event, it should also be inserted to the event list, its occuring time = current time + time slice 
5. If there's any process in the queue waiting to be scheduled, then serve it at once. 
6. If there's no processes, then set the current CPU core available. 

Since the logics have been settled, then we should leave the rest of the codes to you to implement by yourselves.  

## 3. Summary 

In this course, we re-designed the whole bank queue system, and analyzed the event schedule logic of `customerArrived()` and `customerDeparture()` 

After these 3 experiments, we have designed and modele the bank queue system in our daily life. With implementation step by step, we've got the resource competition of CPU, and talked about the round robin schedule procress of non-preemptive schedule.  

Nothing is too sophisticated in computer sciense. Many algorithm ideas come from daily life. So while studying computer sciense, we cab achieve more than we thinke if we connect with the daily life more.
