# Implementation of Core Codes

## 1. Introduction

#### The background knowledge needed 

- Basic syntax knowledge of C++  

#### The knowledge to consolidate and use 

- OOP Programing
- Theory of function `std::rand()`
- Queuing theory
- Data structure of chained queue and implementing its template 
- Design of event-driven 
- Monte Carlo method
- Model of CPU resource competition
- Round robin

#### Problems to be solved

On Christmas Day, a bank only opens from 8 am tp 12 am. Suppose the bank only offers service in `w` service windows on that day, let me ask you:

> 1. How many customers arrive at the bank per minute?
> 2. How long does it take for one customer to occupy the service window? 

#### Throw back to the last experiment

In the last experiment, we have understood the business logic of the whole queue system, and designed the event class to drive the queue system by referring to the idea of event-driven. We have created these files:

1. `Event.hpp`
2. `Node.hpp`
3. `Queue.hpp`
4. `Random.hpp`
5. `ServiceWindow.hpp`
6. `QueueSystem.hpp`
7. `main.cpp`

   In this experiment, we will be focused on the detailed implementation logic of these codes, including:

8. The detailed implementation of chained queue in `Queue.hpp`  
9. The detailed service logic in `QueueSystem.cpp`
10. The more complicated random probability distribution in `Random.hpp`

## 2. Steps

Next, let's write the detailed codes.

### 2.1 Implement Chained Queue Template

In the last experiment, we wrote the basic design requirement of chained queue template. Let's implement the queue next.

#### 2.1.1  The Reason to Design Chained Queue

First, let's explain why we need to use chained queue instead of array queue: As we acknowledged, the advantage of chained list is, the algorithm complexity is  $$O(1)$$. As for the customer queue, enqueuing and dequeuing happen in the both ends of the queue. However, we run into such a question while talking about the event: the events are inserted into the queue by time order, which might not take place in the both ends of the queue. To enable the queue to be the foundation  of both two structures, apparently using chained list is the best option.

#### 2.1.2 Implementation

After making sure we will use chained list structure, there's still a question left unsolved: Do we need to design a head node for chained list? As we know, chained list with head notes are easier to be implement with code. However, a space of an object will be used to put the head node. In the early computer software development, memory is very important. Usually, queues will be designed into chained lists without head notes. But nowadays, this bit of memory won't be worth mentioning. So, we will use chained list with head notes.

Then, the  constructor and destructor  will be in charge of managing the lifecycle as well as maintaining the changes of head notes and tail notes.
Rewrite the `Queue.hpp` under `/home/labex/queuesystem/`

```c++
//
// Queue.hpp
// QueueSystem
//

// Construct a chained queue with head node in the tail of the queue.
Queue() {
    this->front = new T;
    // If it fails to apply for memory, then the program shouldn't keep running 
    if (!this->front) {
        exit(-1);
    }
    
    // Initialize nodes
    this->front->next = NULL;
    this->rear = this->front;
}
// While destroying a queue, you need to relase the memory applied in the notes
~Queue() {
    // Clear the elements in the current queue
    this->clearQueue();
    
    // Then delete the head node
    delete this->front;
}
```

Next, as for the logic of enqueuing and dequeuing: 

```c++
//
// Queue.hpp
// QueueSystem
//

// While enqueuing, pass the node pointer. The external data shouldn't be managed by this class, so copy the data.
// And return the head node
T* enqueue(T &node) {
    T *new_node = new T;
    if (!new_node) {
        exit(-1);
    }
    *new_node = node;
    this->rear->next = new_node;
    this->rear = new_node;
    return this->front;
}
// Dequeue from the head of the queue 
T* dequeue() {
    // If the queue is empty, return the empty pointer 
    if (!this->front->next) {
        return NULL;
    }
    
    T *temp_node;
    temp_node = this->front->next;
    this->front->next = temp_node->next;
    
    // If there's only one node in the queue, then remember to set the pointer of tail node as head pointer.
    if (this->rear == temp_node) {
        this->rear = this->front;
    }
    return temp_node;
}
```

The logic of enqueuing by order for events：

```c++
//
// Queue.hpp
// QueueSystem
//

// If the evnet has its own occuring event, then we should insert it by the event order  
T* orderEnqueue(Event &event) {
    Event* temp = new Event;
    if (!temp) {
        exit(-1);
    }
    *temp = event;
    
    // If there's no event in the list, then insert the temp event 
    if (!this->front->next) {
        this->enqueue(*temp);
        return this->front;
    }
    
    // Insert by time order  
    Event *temp_event_list = this->front;
    
    // If there's a next event, and its occuring time is smaller than the time to insert into, then move on the pointer.
    while (temp_event_list->next && temp_event_list->next->occur_time < event.occur_time) {
        temp_event_list = temp_event_list->next;
    }
    
    // Insert the evnet into the queue 
    temp->next = temp_event_list->next;
    temp_event_list->next = temp;
    
    // Return the head node of the queue 
    return this->front;
}
```

Calculate the length of the queue：

```c++
//
// Queue.hpp
// QueueSystem
//

int  length() {
    T *temp_node;
    temp_node = this->front->next;
    int length = 0;
    while (temp_node) {
        temp_node = temp_node->next;
        ++length;
    }
    return length;
}
```

Last but not least, clear the elements in the current queue：

```c++
//
// Queue.hpp
// QueueSystem
//

void clearQueue() {
    T *temp_node;
    
    while (this->front->next) {
        temp_node = this->front->next;
        this->front->next = temp_node->next;
        delete temp_node;
    }
    
    this->front->next = NULL;
    this->rear = this->front;
}
```

> Note that after deleting the memory of elements in the queue, we should move the **head node and tail node** to the former position. Else, there will be a serious memory leak problem, as the enqueuing is implemented by tail notes. 

In C++, how to effectively manage the dynamically applied memory, has always been a headache. Memory leaking can easily happen if you are not being careful. 

Let's check out the 2 key designs in the enqueuing end dequeuing methods:

1. Though we referred the external data, we didn't directly use it. Instead, we allocated a block of memory in the internal, and copied the external data. 
2. While dequeuing, directly return the pointers allocated for nodes, rather than just copy and return.

In the management of memory, the codes in this project holds this idea: **Those who apply for the memory, release the memory.**

The queue, as an object, should manage the memory used in the internal, release the memory that hasn't been released after the queue lifecycle ends.

  error:
    Oops! We found that you didn't identify "clearQueue()" method in "Queue.hpp".
```

### 2.2 The Implementation of Queue System 

First, when the whole queue system is constructed, the available service window should be create. So we should implement the `destructor function` and `constructor function`. Rewrite the `QueueSystem.cpp` under `/home/labex/queuesystem/`:

```c++
//
// QueueSystem.cpp
// QueueSystem
//

QueueSystem::QueueSystem(int total_service_time, int window_num):
    total_service_time(total_service_time),
    window_num(window_num),
    total_customer_stay_time(0),
    total_customer_num(0) {
    // Create service window
    this->windows = new ServiceWindow[window_num];
}
QueueSystem::~QueueSystem() {
    delete[] windows;
}
void QueueSystem::simulate(int simulate_num) {
    double sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i != simulate_num; ++i) {
        sum += run();
    }
    avg_stay_time = (double)sum / simulate_num;
    avg_customers = (double)total_customer_num / (total_service_time*simulate_num);
}
```

Next is the `simulate()` method：

```c++
//
// QueueSystem.cpp
// QueueSystem
//

void QueueSystem::simulate(int simulate_num) {
    double sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i != simulate_num; ++i) {
        // In every operation, we need to append the time the customers stayed in this simulation 
        sum += run();
    }
    
    // Calculate the average staying time 
    avg_stay_time = (double)sum / simulate_num;
    // Calculate the average customer numbee 
    avg_customers = (double)total_customer_num / (total_service_time*simulate_num);
}
```

Then, as for methods `run()`, `init()`, `end()` , they deploy the dynamic operation of the whole system. Meanwhile, the operation is driven by `event_list`:

```c++
//
// QueueSystem.cpp
// QueueSystem
//

// The system starts running, initialize the system and the chained list of events, deploy the first event. 
void QueueSystem::init() {
    // The first event must be the arriving event. Use the default structure. 
    Event *event = new Event;
    current_event = event;
}
// The system starts operating, keeping consuming the event lists. The operation ends when the consumption is ended.
double QueueSystem::run() {
    this->init();
    while (current_event) {
        // Judge the type of the current event 
        if (current_event->event_type == -1) {
            customerArrived();
        } else {
            customerDeparture();
        }
        delete current_event;
        // Get the new event 
        current_event = event_list.dequeue();
    };
    this->end();
    // Return the average staying time of customers 
    return (double)total_customer_stay_time/total_customer_num;
}
// The system operation ends. Set all service windows available, and clear the customer queue and the event list.
void QueueSystem::end() {
    // Set all winodws available 
    for (int i=0; i != window_num; ++i) {
        windows[i].setIdle();
    }
    // Clear customer queue  
    customer_list.clearQueue();
    
    // Clear event list 
    event_list.clearQueue();

}
```

Last, here we are at the core logic: Process the arriving event and departure event of customers. 

Let's check out the logic of arriving event in the first place: 

1. When a customer arrives, the total customer number should be increased.
2. When the current event happens, the next customer should be created. If the next customer arrives before the bank closes, then it should be appended to the event list. 
3. The arrived customers of the current events should be inserted into the queue.
4. If any service windows are available, then the first customer in the queue should be served. 
5. As the service starts, the departure time should be decided. This is when you need to insert a departure event of the customers in the event list by order.

Do you still remember we've mentioned in the last experiment that, the arriving time of customers shouldn't be decided by ourselves? Here's why:

Now, the system we designed is event-driven. And when a customer arrives, the arriving time of the next customer will be known. That is how all the arriving events are created.

As you can understand, this is exactly why we don't let the clients to decide the arriving time of customers.

> Of course, you can also let the whole bank system decide all the events of the day when it's just created. In this way, the arriving time of customers can be decide by themselves.

```c++
//
// QueueSystem.cpp
// QueueSystem
//

// Process arriving event of customers 
void QueueSystem::customerArrived() {
    
    total_customer_num++;
    
    // Create the arriving event of the next customer 
    
    int intertime = Random::uniform(100);  // 
    The timer interval between the arrival of two customers. We assume that there must be one customer in 100 minutes. 
    // The arriving time of the next customer = The occuring time of the current event and the time interval when the next customer arrives. 
    int time = current_event->occur_time + intertime;
    Event temp_event(time);
    // If the arriving time of the next customer is less than the total service time, then insert this event into the event list. 
    // Meanwhile, this customer is appended into customer_list to queue 
    if (time < total_service_time) {
        event_list.orderEnqueue(temp_event);
    } 
     // Else, it won't be inserted into event list or cusomer_list
     // Process the arrived customers in the current event 
    Customer *customer = new Customer(current_event->occur_time);
    if (!customer) {
        exit(-1);
    }
    customer_list.enqueue(*customer);
    
    // Send the customer to the available window if there's one 
    int idleIndex = getIdleServiceWindow();
    if (idleIndex >= 0) {
        customer = customer_list.dequeue();
        windows[idleIndex].serveCustomer(*customer);
        windows[idleIndex].setBusy();
        
        // When the customer is getting served, we need to insert the departure event of this customer to `event_list`
        // The occuring time of departure event = The occuring time of the current event + service time
        Event temp_event(current_event->occur_time + customer->duration, idleIndex);
        event_list.orderEnqueue(temp_event);
    }
    delete customer;
}
```

The implementation of `getIdleServiceWindow()`:

```c++
//
// QueueSystem.cpp
// QueueSystem
//

int QueueSystem::getIdleServiceWindow() {
    for (int i=0; i!=window_num; ++i) {
        if (windows[i].isIdle()) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

Next, there're several logics when it comes to processing the departure event of customers:

1. If the bank closes when the customer leaves, then it leaves us nothing to process, as all the queues will be destroyed. Besides, according to the process design of the arriving event. If the arriving customer number is bigger than the total service event number, then the extract part of customers won't be appended to the event list. So just process the departure events left for us. 
2. When customers leaves, the staying time of customers in the bank = The waiting time in the queue + service time.  
3. If there's still customers waiting in the queue when the current customer left, then they must be served at one. Else, the current window should be set as available. 

So：

```c++
//
// QueueSystem.cpp
// QueueSystem
//

// Process the departure event of customers 
void QueueSystem::customerDeparture() {
    // If the occuring time of departure event is bigger than the service time, then it leaves us nothing to process. 
    if (current_event->occur_time < total_service_time) {
        // Staying time of customers = The departure time of current customer - the arriving time 
        total_customer_stay_time += current_event->occur_time - windows[current_event->event_type].getCustomerArriveTime();
        // If someone waits in the queue, serve him/her at once
        if (customer_list.length()) {
            Customer *customer;
            customer = customer_list.dequeue();
            windows[current_event->event_type].serveCustomer(*customer);
            
            // departure event 
            Event temp_event(
                current_event->occur_time + customer->duration,
                current_event->event_type
            );
            event_list.orderEnqueue(temp_event);
            
            delete customer;
        } else {
            // If there's nobody in the queue, and the customer in the current window leaves, then it makes this window available. 
            windows[current_event->event_type].setIdle();
        }
        
    }
}
```

So far, we rewrote `Queue.hpp` ，appended `QueueSystem.cpp`. Let's get the final operation work done:

```bash
$ g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp QueueSystem.cpp -o main 
$ ./main
```


![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/B/E/M/EfB4aLerbAGd.png)


As you can see, there should be at least one customer in every 100 minutes. And his/her service time is a uniformly distributed random value between 0-100 minutes. The result after 100000 simulations is:  

1. Every customer stayed in the bank for average 34.85 minutes.
2. 0.01 customer arrive at the bank average per minute, which means, only one customer arrives in every 100 minutes(which proves our program right)

## 3. Expansions

**The Complicated Probability Distribution Which is Closer to the Realistic Law(optional)**

The result is not right enough. 

The mathematicians have made a more scientific and rigorous research of queue question(The Bell Lab did a series of researches to solve the problem of queuing in getting phone calls), and gave out a theory of queue, named the `Queueing Theory`. They have proved these two solutions:

1. **If the average arrived customer number is n per unit time, then the time interval of every two customers' arriving time is subject to Poisson distribution with an argument of 1/n, as a random variable.**
2. **If the average service time need for every customer is t, then t should be subject to exponential distribution with an argument of 1/t**

> By seeing this solution, you should be convinced of why the arriving time of the next customer should be randomly generated when the current customer arrives. Because the time interval is subject to Poisson distribution, which makes it easier for us to prove the experiment result.

According to the formula of Poisson distribution and exponential distribution：

**Poisson distribution：**

$$P(X=k)=\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda ^k}{k!}$$

**Exponential distribution：**

When $$x < 0$$ , $$P(x) = 0$$

Else，$$P(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$$

First let's implement the exponential distribution and Poisson distribution in `Random.hpp`.
Rewrite `Random.hpp` under `/home/labex/queuesystem/`:

```c++
//
//  Random.hpp
//  QueueSystem
//

#ifndef Random_hpp
#define Random_hpp

#include <cstdlib>
#include <cmath>

enum RandomType {
    UNIFORM,
    EXPONENTAIL,
    POISSON,
};

class Random {
public:

    // Set the distribution type and arguments, get the random value 
    static double getRandom(RandomType type, double parameter) {
        switch (type) {
            case UNIFORM:
                return uniform(parameter);
                break;
            case EXPONENTAIL:
                return exponentail(parameter);
            case POISSON:
                return poisson(parameter);
            default:
                return 0;
                break;
        }
    }
    // The random uniformly distributed between [0, 1)  
    static double uniform(double max = 1) {
        return ((double)std::rand() / (RAND_MAX))*max;
    }
    // The random subject to lambda-exponential distribution 
    static double exponentail(double lambda) {
        return -log(1 - uniform()) / lambda;
    }
    // The random subject to lambda-Poisson distribution 
    static double poisson(double lambda) {
        int t = 0;
        double p = exp(-lambda);
        double f = p;
        double u = uniform();
        while (true) {
            if (f > u)
                break;
            t++;
            p = p*lambda / t;
            f += p;
        }
        return t;
    }
};

#endif /* Random_hpp */
```

Then, let's rewrite the logic of creating random numbers in queue system. Assume that 2 customers arrive per minute, then in `QueueSystem.cpp` and `Event.hpp`, we should change the time internal of arriving time and the default arriving event(the first arriving event) into Poisson distribution.

```c++
// QueueSystem.cpp
int intertime = Random::uniform(100);  // The time interval of the next customer. Soppose that at least one customer would show up in 100 minutes.
```

```c++
// Event.hpp
Event(int occur_time = Random::uniform(RANDOM_PARAMETER),
          int event_type = -1):
```

Rewrite：

```c++
// QueueSystem.cpp
int intertime = Random::getgetRandom(POISSON, 0.5);  // The time interval of the next arriving customer, subject t o Poisson distribution with an argument of 2.
```

```c++
// Event.hpp
Event(int occur_time = Random::getRandom(POISSON, 0.5), int event_type = -1):
```

If the average service needed for every customer is 10 minutes, then the service time `duration` of `Node.hpp` should be changed into exponential distribution: 

```c++
// Node.hpp
Node(int arrive_time = 0,
         int duration = Random::uniform(RANDOM_PARAMETER)):
```

Rewrite：

```c++
// Node.hpp
Node(int arrive_time = 0,
         int duration = Random::getRandom(EXPONENTAIL, 0.1)):
```

Now you can test it again, but it costs too mach time.

The result is：

1. Average every customer stayed in the bank for 19.80 minutes
2. Average 2 customers arrive per minute（which proves our program operates right again, and as well as close to the result of the theory)

## 4. Summary 

In this course, we have implemented the codes of the core business logics for the whole bank queue system. Additionally, the following files have been written too: 

1. The detailed implementation of chained queue in `Queue.hpp`  
2. The detailed service logic in `QueueSystem.cpp`
3. The more complicated random probability distribution in `Random.hpp`

Since it's a summary, we have the whole codes so far for you. Get it from the following link：

```bash
wget https://labexfile.oss-us-west-1-internal.aliyuncs.com/courses/88/QueueSystem.zip
```

In the next course, we will extend the codes much further, discuss the problems more in the computer level: The similarity of how CPU runs in multi-task scheduling problem and in this problem. Meanwhile, consolidate the knowledge about Round robin of the modern operating system.
