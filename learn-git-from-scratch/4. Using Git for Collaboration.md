# Using Git for Collaboration

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to lab 3. In this lab we will be learning about how to do branched development in Git, as well as merging files and working with remote repositories.

#### Learning Objective

- Understand the theory behind branched development (including graph theory).
- Understand the different ways of making new branches in a git repository and moving between them using `git checkout`.
- Understand the concept of repository tags.
- Understand the process of merging branches in a git repository.
- Understand what a merge conflict is and how Git manages them.
- Understand what processes are automated during merging and what is not.
- Understand the process of manually resolving a merge conflict that Git cannot.
- Understand the concept of remote repositories through the example of a local bare repository.
- Understand the concept of remotes and how to create, delete and rename them.
- Practice and understand the process of moving data to and from a remote repository (using `git fetch`, `git pull` and `git push`).

## 2. Git Version Management
- Git graph mode
- Git branch
- Repository tags
- Some best practice tips

### 2.1 The Graph Model - Merge Tree

Before we dive into creating branches in a Git repository, let's take a brief few moments to understand branched development. Note that this concept is not a 'Git concept', it is a concept if software development in general.

In the graph model, we can represent a project as a 'rooted directed acyclic graph'. For our purposes, let's just call it a 'tree with branches and merges'. Consider the diagram below for a simple development project.


![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/Q/U/E/me7B0nUCs50k.png)

#### 2.1.1 Revisions

A revision is basically a snapshot of the project at a specific time. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will treat each commit as a revision. In the graph each revision is represented as a circle (which is numbered in chronological order). 

#### 2.1.2 Root of the Tree

The root of the tree is simply the oldest revision that exists in the repository. In this example, revision 1 is considered the root of the tree.

In more complex workflows, multiple trees can be merged as repositories are merged, meaning that the root may change over time. However, this is beyond the scope of this course.

#### 2.1.3 Branching and Merging

As you can see, there are multiple branches on this graph. A branch is basically a fork in the tree and gives a unique development path. For example, revisions 2 and 3 are on a separate branch than the branch that includes revisions 1, 4 and 9. On the graph, separated branches are the yellow circles.

Branches can also be merged (as denoted on the graph by the red arrows). For example, you can see that revision 4 is actually based on 2 different branches and thus two different revisions (1 and 3). It is important to note that branches do not always need to be merged, and some can be considered discontinued (like revision 10).

#### 2.1.4 The Trunk (Mainline)

This is applicable to simple projects like this. In this example, the trunk of the project is denoted in green. This is basically the versions of a project that are fully working. When changes need to be made, they are done in branches, then merged into the trunk when they are functional. Hence, the trunk isn't actually modified directly.

A project does not need to have a trunk, but many consider it good practice to do so, because it makes the workflow tidier. By convention, this is a branch called 'master'.

#### 2.1.5 Tips and the HEAD

Finally, the end of a branch is considered a tip. In the example, there are currently four tips - revisions 3, 7, 9 and 10 (even though the branch including 10 was discontinued).

When working in Git, it is possible to change which tip your repository is working on using `git checkout`. The tip you are currently working on is considered the HEAD.

### 2.2 Git Branch

Now that we have covered the graph theory and understand branched development, we will now recreate the project in the example.

First, initialize a new repository, move into it, and make a first commit.

```shell
$ cd ~/Code
$ git init BranchRepo
$ cd BranchRepo
$ touch FirstFile
$ git add FirstFile
$ git commit -m "1 - First Commit to Master"
```

Good!

Now, create a new branch called 'branch1'. This branch will hold revisions 2 and 3. Run the following two commands, the first will create a new branch, and the second will return a list of all branches.

```shell
$ git branch 'branch1`
$ git branch
```

![Branch List](https://labex.io/upload/E/T/V/21wCPDKyaCmn.jpg)

The output shows that our HEAD is currently on the tip of the 'master' branch. Now, move your HEAD into your branch using `git checkout`.

```shell
$ git checkout branch1
$ git branch
```

![Changed Branch](https://labex.io/upload/N/Y/E/Oo4x5pabFF6O.jpg)


As you can see, our HEAD has moved, now we are working in 'branch1'. Next, we will create revisions 2 and 3. Use the following commands to do so.

```shell
$ touch SecondFile
$ git add SecondFile
$ git commit -m '2'
$ touch ThirdFile
$ git add ThirdFile
$ git commit -m '3'
```

Now you will have made two new commits on 'branch1'. Use `git log` to view your commit history, then switch back to the 'master' branch and view the commit history there. Also use `ls` to view the working directory of your 'master' branch.

```shell
$ git log
$ git checkout master
$ git log
$ ls
```

**branch1:**
![Unmerged Branch1](https://labex.io/upload/O/D/F/efNiyItlaN6Y.jpg)

**master:**
![Unmerged Master](https://labex.io/upload/W/M/L/HhEf2ANoTjrr.jpg)

As you can see, there are commits in 'branch1' that are not in 'master'. You can also see that changing branches updates the working directory, because the files that were created in 'branch1' are not in 'master'.

The next part of the tutorial will involve merging the changes of 'branch1' into the 'master' branch.

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'git\s+branch' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "git branch" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.3 Merging Branches

`git merge`  can be used to merge different project branches in a branched development workflow. Run the following command to merge 'branch1' into 'master'. Also check the log and working directory after the merge.

```shell
$ git merge --no-ff branch1 -m "4 - Merge Branch1 into Master"
$ git log
$ ls
```

![Merge](https://labex.io/upload/J/C/T/4igip98BjRjM.jpg)


As you can see, the files from 'branch1' are now present in the working directory of 'master'. All the commits have been copied over as well (shown by `git log`).

Let's quickly break down the command we used.

Merging a branch can be done using the following. This command merges the specified branch into the current one (the specified branch remains unchanged). All changes by the merge are not committed and can be undone with regular Git cleaning tools.

```shell
$ git merge <branch>
```

To conduct the merge and send the merge to the repository as a commit (all at once), you can use the `--no-ff` flag. However, this is not usually recommended (the reason why will become apparent shortly).

```shell
$ git merge --no-ff <branch>
```

This command would open a text editor to prompt for a commit message. You can add the `-m` flag and message to the command like this (just like when we commit).

```shell
$ git merge --no-ff <branch> -m "<Message>"
```
```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'git\s+merge' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "git merge" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.4 Using Tags in Your Repository

#### 2.4.1 Creating Tags

Tags are another useful feature in Git. They can be used to mark a commit that you can easily travel back to. Generally, you can use tags to mark major working development versions that you can easily visit.

For example, create a tag on the current version using the first command. Then list all tags with the second one.

```shell
$ git tag v1.0
$ git tag -n
```

![First Tag](https://labex.io/upload/T/U/O/o1T16rm9A6j0.jpg)

As you can see a tag has been created for the current commit.

You can also add tags to previous commits. Use `git log` to retrieve the identifier of the first commit then use the following command.

```shell
$ git tag v0.0 <Commit ID>
$ git tag -n
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/Q/D/G/x6Xi2Z617S3Q.jpg)

As you can see, a tag has been added to the first commit you made.

#### 2.4.2 Travelling Via Tags

Now you can check out the commit that your tag is associated with using `git checkout`. This will send you into a detached HEAD state just like when you check out an old commit.

(TIP: Before you check out the first commit, look at your working directory contents).

```shell
$ ls
$ git checkout v0.0
$ ls
```
![](https://labex.io/upload/I/U/A/om5tT3adlKwr.jpg)

As you can see, your working directory has changed.

Now, use `git checkout` to go back to your other tag (ie. the tip of your 'master' branch).

```shell
$ git checkout v1.0
```

Check your working directory contents again, then run `git status`

```shell
$ ls
$ git status
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/K/O/K/dkNu4LrRote4.jpg)

WAIT! You're clearly back at the right place, but you are still in detached HEAD mode. You cannot travel back to the tip of your branch using tags. To get out of detached HEAD mode, you must specify the branch. Try it now.

```shell
$ git checkout master
$ git status
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/S/R/G/uOzZW2TIWUoE.jpg)

Perfect! All is right in your repository.

#### 2.4.3 Deleting Tags

Since the 'v0.0' tag was not in our work flow, you can delete it using the `-d` flag (we will also delete our 'v1.0' tag in this tutorial).

```shell
$ git tag -d v0.0 v1.0
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/J/M/S/lzBFkkMcqwm1.jpg)

As you can see, all tags passed as arguments were deleted.

#### 2.4.4 Tag Messages

By default, when you create a tag, its message will be the same as the commit it is attached to.

Similar to commits, you can also attach custom messages to your tags to give them better descriptions. This is done in the same way that you do when you make a commit, use the `-m` flag. Create the following tag on the current commit with a message.

```shell
$ git tag v1.0 -m "First major version"
$ git tag -n
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/U/L/B/juBRbnjVbu85.jpg)

There, much more readable!


```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'git\s+tag' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "git tag" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.5 Best Practices When Using Branched Development Models

The following tips are not essential, but are considered good practice when dealing with branched development projects.

**(1) Keep your working code in branches separate from the master branch.**

This is important, especially when you are working on major and potentially disruptive changes to the code, are experimenting with changes that may not work, or making changes that may not be used.

**(2) Merge back into the master branch as often as possible.**

Assuming that the changes in your branch are functional, try to keep up to date with the master branch as much as possible (other people may be making changes). If your code isn't ready, you can always merge master branch changes into your own branch (instead of the other way around).

**(3) Commit identifiers are not tags. Make sure that you mark major code versions in the master branch.**

Properly marking major versions with tags is important. As well as making everything more readable and easier to use, it can also speed up the process of recovering an older version if something major goes wrong with a newer one.

### 2.6 More Practice

That's it for the part of the lab dedicated to branched development. If you haven't aleady realized, we only covered revisions 1-4 on the workflow.

For a challenge that really tests your knowledge, complete this workflow in our current repository (you have learned all the concepts and processes that you require for this task).

## 3. Conflict
- Merge repository conflict
- Manage file conflict
### 3.1 What is a Merge Conflict?

So far, we have just been using empty files when we were merging our repository. However, in a real life situation, files being merged will more than likely have content in them. This can make the process far more complex than it was in the previous example.

File merging and conflict control can be a daunting process for those new to Git, but don't panic just yet. Compared to other version control systems, Git handles merges considerably well.

A merge conflict basically occurs when two versions of the same file (from separate branches) have different contents.

For the next part of the tutorial, we will use a new repository. Move back to your Code directory, and create a new repository as follows (note we have simply joined the initialize command with the change directory command to save time).

```shell
$ cd ~/Code
$ git init MergeRepo && cd MergeRepo
```

Now, for this tutorial, we will create a simple python script. Use the command to open a text editor then add the following contents into the script.

```shell
$ vim add.py
```

```shell
a = 4
b = 5

print(a+b)
```

Note that you can run this script and it will return 9.

```shell
$ python add.py
```

Commit this file as 'first commit'.

```shell
$ git add add.py
$ git commit -m 'first commit'
```

Create a branch called 'alternate' in this repository as well (this branch will also include the first commit).

```shell
$ git branch alternate
```

### 3.2 How Git Manages File Conflicts

#### 3.2.1 What is Automated?

First, let's make a conflict that can be automatically handled by Git. Generally these are changes like inserting lines.

Switch to the 'alternate' branch and modify the contents of the python file as shown below, then commit the changes.

```shell
$ git checkout alternate
$ vim add.py
```

```shell
a = 4
b = 5
c = "Hello World"

print(a+b)
print(c)
```

Now commit this change and switch back to the master branch.

```shell
$ git add add.py
$ git commit -m 'added c'
$ git checkout master
```

If you want, you can check that the file is still the same on the 'master' branch and has not been modified. You can also use `git log` to see that the commit you just made in the 'alternate' branch is not in the 'master' branch.

```shell
$ cat add.py
$ git log
```

So, at present, there are two different versions of  `add.py`  in the repository, one on the 'master' branch and one in the 'alternate' branch.

**Master Branch**  vs **Alternate Branch**

![Master Branch File](https://labex.io/upload/Y/X/J/qHgVs9En0lJA.png)

Now, let's perform the merge. We will be merging the 'alternate' branch into the 'master' branch (note that this command will not make a new commit so we will do this afterward). Before we commit, we can check the file to see the result of the merge.

```shell
$ git checkout master
$ git merge alternate
$ cat add.py
```

As you can find that the lines have been added to the file in the 'master' branch. Git has handled the entire merge process automatically because it is simple.

#### 3.2.2 Complex Merge Conflict

Now, in order to keep our repository simple, let's reset both our branches. Before you execute the following commands, use `git log` to determine the commit ID of the **first commit** you made (this should be the same for both branches).

```shell
$ git checkout master
$ git reset --hard <Commit ID>
$ git checkout alternate
$ git reset --hard <CommitID>
```

Now the file should be at its original state in BOTH branches. Check this if you like (just be sure that you are on the 'alternate' branch for the next step).

What we will do next, is create a situation where the merge is not so simple. In the 'alternate' branch, run the following command and modify the contents of the script by changing the value of *a* to a 3 (as shown).

```shell
$ vim add.py
```

```shell
a = 3
b = 5

print(a+b)
```

Commit these changes then switch the HEAD back to the 'master' branch.

```shell
$ git add add.py
$ git commit -m 'a is 3'
$ git checkout master
```

Now, in the master branch, you will do the same thing, however, change *a* to 5 instead of 3.

```shell
$ vim add.py
```

```shell
a = 5
b = 5

print(a+b)
```

Commit these changes as well.

```shell
$ git add add.py
$ git commit -m 'a is 5'
```

Good! Now the `add.py` file should exist in two states. One where *a* is 3 and another where *a* is 5 (see below), and these have both been modified in commits after the branch was formed.

**Master Branch**  vs **Alternate Branch**

![Complex Change Master Branch](https://labex.io/upload/C/A/D/aTZBnkG2cyuf.jpg)


Now we will try and conduct the merge. Run the following command (note that we are NOT forcing the changes to be committed at the same time). Again, we are merging the 'alternate' branch into the 'master' branch.

```shell
$ git checkout master
$ git merge alternate
$ git status
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/X/M/J/sq7pWtD4lq8X.jpg)

As you can see, Git could not automatically merge some changes. This is because it doesn't know whether it should make *a* equal to 3 or *a* equal to 5. Running `git status` confirms that there are unresolved conflicts.

Note that the merge process handled by Git is completed already. 

Try running the python script.

```shell
$ python add.py
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/K/N/Y/YDbi7Ojl5Vlp.jpg)

As you can see, it does not run properly anymore because Git has changed it. Open the file and view the contents.

```shell
$ vim add.py
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/I/R/X/ixnEPwiaYcIK.jpg)

Whoa! What happened? Lucky this wasn't committed.

**Did Git butcher my file?**

Yes and no. What Git actually did was modify the file so that it includes both versions (this is what `git status` told us).

Before committing it, you will need to manually clear up the file yourself. This will involve deciding whether *a* should be 3 or 5. In this tutorial, we will make it 5. You will need to remove the added lines from Git, as well as the line we don't want. It should look something like this when you are done.

![](https://labex.io/upload/O/O/A/oNQVleL5HpUo.jpg)


Just before you commit the merged changes, double check that the script works and returns 10 (as expected).

```shell
$ python add.py
```

Perfect! Now we can commit the changes.

```shell
$ git add add.py
$ git commit -m "Merge"
```

Congratulations! You have successfully completed your first complex merge.

**Undoing Merge Changes (You Cannot Break Anything)**

When merging, seeing your files changed like that can be disconcerting. It is important to realize that when your are merging; you cannot cause any permanent damage.

It is good practice to commit all working directory changes before merging (in fact, Git will not allow the merge unless you do). This ensures easy rollback.

There are many ways to undo merge actions (although `git checkout` will NOT restore your directory). If you have not committed the merge changes, you can simply do a hard reset.

```shell
$ git reset --hard
```

If you have already done the merge, you can reset to an old commit or use `git checkout` to obtain an old version of a bad file.

Also, something to bear in mind is that the branch you are merging into your HEAD is NOT AFFECTED (hence, our 'alternate' branch was not changed in the merge).
```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'git\s+checkout' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "git checkout" cmd.
  timeout: 3
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'git\s+reset' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "git reset" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
## 4. Remote Repositories

We will not be making a remote repository on a dedicated hosting platform in this lab. However to learn these concepts, we will be creating a local bare repository and treating it like a remote one instead. Usage is almost exactly the same.

To begin, navigate back to your home directory and create a bare repository using the following commands.

```shell
$ cd ~/Code
$ git init --bare SimulatedRemote.git
```

Good, a pretend 'remote' repository has been created (in fact, if a bare repository was appropriately hosted on a server, it could be used as a true remote repository).

Next, use the following move back into your 'BranchedRepo' from the first part of this lab. This will act as our 'local repository' for the next part of the lab.

```shell
$ cd ~/Code/BranchRepo
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/M/L/W/pqS6nyh8Seya.jpg)

Now that we have created all of our materials, we are ready to learn about remote repositories.

### 4.1 Creating a New Remote (Git Remote Add)

In Git, a remote is basically a connection between two repositories that can be used to send data between them. A prime example of this is the connection between a shared remote repository and a local one.

Also be aware that a repository may have multiple remotes.

First, we will create a new remote in our local repository. This is done using the `git remote add` command.

```shell
$ git remote add FirstRemote ../SimulatedRemote.git
$ git remote -v
```

This will create a new remote called FirstRemote. Running the command `git remote -v` will return a list of all repository remotes and confirms that a remote has been created. The general syntax of this command is outlined below. Bear in mind that instead of a URL, we have used a local relative path to our 'remote' repository. However, a URL would work just as well.

```shell
$ git remote add <Remote Name> <Target URL>
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/C/P/Q/rLaoBO3K331z.jpg)


#### 4.1.1 Renaming Remotes

You can also rename a remote using the following command.

```shell
$ git remote rename <Old Name> <New Name>
```


Try it now, rename your 'FirstRemote' to 'origin'

```shell
$ git remote rename FirstRemote origin
$ git remote -v
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/Y/S/Y/47FmrVmCyNsr.jpg)

As you can see, the remote's name has changed yet it still points to the same place.

*Recall from the first lab, that if you clone a repository it automatically creates a remote to the original one and calls it 'origin'.*

#### 4.1.2 Removing Remotes

Remotes can also be removed with the following command. Don't do this now though, because we will still need this remote for later.

```shell
$ git remote rm <Remote Name>
```

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'git\s+remote' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "git remote" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 4.2 Pushing and Pulling (Git Push and Git Pull)

#### 4.2.1 Git Push

Generally, remote repositories do not have a working directory (just like bare repositories). Thus you cannot make commits to it, not directly at least. Instead you must send commits to it from other repositories.

`git push` is a command used to move data away from a repository via a remote. Note that you can only push commits, not individual files.

We already have commits on multiple branches in this repository, so we will push all of those.

```shell
$ git push origin --all
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/F/P/E/JOOxugy96mOi.jpg)

As you can see, the command has successfully pushed the commit to the repository (note a single push can handle multiple commits). As you can see by the output, we have created matching branches in the remote repository that we can push data to.

The general syntax of push is included below.

```shell
$ git push <Remote> <Branch(s)>
```

Alternatively, as we did above, you can use the `--all` flag to push all local branches to the remote repository. Multiple branches can be separated as spaces.

By default, you cannot push to a remote if the remote repository has commits that are ahead of the ones in the local repository. This is a safety feature which ensures you do not overwrite commits in the remote repository. The best way to solve this is to do a pull to update your local repository first.

If you want to make the push anyway, use the `--force` flag.

Use the following commands to move back into the remote repository and view the branch names and logs.

```shell
$ cd ~/Code/SimulatedRemote.git
$ git branch
$ git status
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/D/J/P/FmXHtpF4m6xt.jpg)

As you can see, the commit data has successfully been copied to the remote repository for each branch.

#### 4.2.2 Git Fetch

Before we deal with pulling, let's briefly look at `git fetch`. This command is simply used to retrieve branches from the remote repository back into the local one. Note that branches that are pulled are NOT merged into the local repository branches, but are stored separately as *remote branches*.

Not including the branch specification in the general command below will import all branches as remote branches.

```shell
$ git fetch <Remote> <Branch>
```

#### 4.2.3 Git Pull

We did not use `git fetch` in this tutorial. This is because, when you call `git pull`, `git fetch` is automatically called implicitly. The difference is that `git pull` automatically merges the branches into the local repository.

First, let's make another empty repository in our home directory.

```shell
$ cd ~/Code
$ git init NewRepo && cd NewRepo
```

Next, make a remote back to the remote repository (call it origin).

```shell
$ git remote add origin ../SimulatedRemote.git
```

`git pull` is generally used to import a single branch from a repository and merge it into the current local repository HEAD (hence only one branch can be done at a time). It is common practice to regularly pull from the remote repository.

```shell
$ git pull <Remote> <Branch>
```

Run the following command to pull the master branch from the remote and merge it with the master branch of the current repository.

```shell
$ git pull origin master
$ git branch -a
$ ls
```

![](https://labex.io/upload/Y/Q/S/BnnAiCrxQIdt.jpg)

Good! As you can see, Git has successfully pulled the branch into your repository and merged it with the master. The working directory also holds the files from the latest commit. Using the `-a` flag also shows the remote branches that are in the reposiotry. These can also be viewed via `git checkout`.
```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'git\s+push' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "git push" cmd.
  timeout: 3
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'git\s+fetch' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "git fetch" cmd.
  timeout: 3
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'git\s+pull' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Oops, you didn't use "git pull" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
## 5. Summary

Congratulations on finishing lab 3! In the next lab (which is the final lab), we will actually be creating a remote repository and using it.
