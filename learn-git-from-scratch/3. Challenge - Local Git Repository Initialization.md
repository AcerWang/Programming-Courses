## Introduction

Based on what we've learned before, let's create our first local Git repository. We need to set up personal information in Git, including username and email. In addition, we need to initialize the local Git repository and add some project files.

## Objective

1. Set up Git information (name and email);
2. Complete the local Git repository initialization;
3. Set connection to the remote repository
4. Create and commit README.md file (no need to push it to remote repository)

## Standard

1. Local Git repository directory is `/home/labex/HelloGit/`
2. Remote repository directory is `git@labex.io/HelloGit.git`. Remote version is `origin`.
3. Create `README.md` in `/home/labex/HelloGit/` directory. File name is `README.md` and add `Hello World` to it.

## Tips

`git init`, `git commit` command practice.
