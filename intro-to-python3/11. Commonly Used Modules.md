# Commonly Used Modules

## 1. Introduction

In this experiment, we will introduce the commonly used modules in Python, these modules allow us to develop a Python project more efficiently. These modules will be used in subsequent project combat.

#### Learning Objective

* DateTime: time date and related calculation
* os: operating system related operations
* sys: acquiring the Python interpreter's state
* requests: network request processing
* base64: Binary data encoding 64 printable ASCII characters
* collections: providing a range of special container classes

## 2. Modules
- DateTime
- os
- sys
- requests
- base64
- collections 
### 2.1 DateTime

`datetime` module provides classes for manipulating the date and time and its associated calculations.Here are three most commonly used types:
- `date` encapsulates date operation
- `datetime` package date + time operation
- `timedelta` represents a time interval, which is the difference between the date and time

Aquisition of date and time

```python
from datetime import date, datetime, timedelta
date.today()
datetime.date(2018, 2, 9)
datetime.utcnow()
datetime.datetime(2018, 2, 9, 8, 16, 16, 878873)
t = datetime.now()
t
datetime.datetime(2018, 2, 9, 16, 16, 41, 479807)
t.day
9
t.year
2018
t.minute
16
```

The conversion between the datetime object and the string

```python
t
datetime.datetime(2018, 2, 9, 16, 16, 16, 878873)
datetime.strftime(t, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
'2018-02-09 16:16:16'
datetime.strptime('2017-10-01 00:00:00', '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
datetime.datetime(2017, 10, 1, 0, 0)
```

Use `timedelta` to represent the time difference, which can be accurate to microseconds

```python
timedelta(days=0, seconds=0, microseconds=0, milliseconds=0, minutes=0, hours=0, weeks=0)
```

Use `timedelta` to add and subtract datetime

```python
t
datetime.datetime(2018, 2, 9, 16, 16, 41, 479807)
t + timedelta(weeks=1, days=-3, hours=3, minutes=-10)
datetime.datetime(2018, 2, 13, 19, 6, 41, 479807)
```

### 2.2 os

`os` module provides some interface to get some information about the operating system and use the operating system.
Here are the commonly used one

```python
import os
# To get the current working directory
os.getcwd()
'/home/labex'

# Generates n bytes of random numbers for encryption, such as SECRET_KEY as Flask
os.urandom(24)
b'a^\xe8\xadE\n\xa9\x90\xa7\xe2nO17;\x87\xdd\x05B\xd4\xd8\x99?\xa4'

# Create a directory in the current directory
os.mkdir('web-app')

# Create an app.py file in the current directory
os.mknod(os.getcwd() + '/app.py')
```

### 2.3 sys

The sys module can be used to get some of the current status variables of the Python interpreter. The most common use is to get the parameters passed when executing the Python script, such as passing some parameters when executing `test.py`:

```shell
python3 test.py arg1 arg2 arg3
```

Then in the Python program you can use `sys.argv` to get these parameters

```python
sys.argv  # ['test.py', 'arg1', 'arg2', 'arg3']
```

`sys.argv` returns a list of the first value to execute the file name

### 2.4 requests

If you have written a crawlers, you shall be familiar with this library. Before the `requests` library appears, the network request usually uses the ` urllib` in the standard library. After `requests`, it normally becomes the actual standard library of network request in Python. 

the interface of `requests` is simple

```python
import requests
r = requests.get('https://www.labex.io')
r.status_code
200
r.headers['content-type']
'text/html; charset=utf-8'
r.text
'\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang="zh-CN">\n    <head>\n        <meta charset="utf-8">\n        <meta http-eq...'
```

Request JSON data

```python
r = requests.get('https://api.github.com')
r.json()
{'current_user_url': 'https://api.github.com/user', }
```

The `json ()` method will convert the returned JSON data into a Python dictionary.

You can also use requests to execute `POST`,` DELETE` and other HTTP methods.

### 2.5 base64

base64 is a coding method.It can code binary data into 64 printable ASCII characters. Base64 requires that every three 8Bit bytes need to be converted into four 6Bit bytes (3 * 8 = 4 * 6 = 24), and then add two high 0 to 6Bit, composing four 8Bit bytes, that is to say, the conversed string will be theoretically longer than the original by 1/3.

```python
import base64
base64.b64encode(b'Hello, labex!')
b'SGVsbG8sIHNoaXlhbmxvdSE='
base64.b64decode(b'SGVsbG8sIHNoaXlhbmxvdSE=')
b'Hello, labex!'
```

### 2.6 collections

The `collections` module mainly provides some special containers, and in specific cases, we will make the problem easier by using these containers.

#### 2.6.1 OrderedDict

`OrderedDict` is a special dictionary. The dictionary is essentially a hash table, and its implementation is generally disordered, but `OrderedDict` can maintain the order of element insertion

```python
from collections import OrderedDict
d = OrderedDict()
d['apple'] = 1
d['google'] = 2
d['facebook'] = 3
d['amazon'] = 4
d
OrderedDict([('apple', 1), ('goole', 2), ('google', 2), ('facebook', 3), ('amazon', 4)])
```


![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/S/R/N/F8o44mpQ0IFz.png)

`OrderedDict` can also iterate or serialize in the order that elements are inserted

```python
for key in d:
  print(key, d[key])
...
apple 1
goole 2
google 2
facebook 3
amazon 4
import json
json.dumps(d)
'{"apple": 1, "goole": 2, "google": 2, "facebook": 3, "amazon": 4}'
```

#### 2.6.2 namedtuple

The use of ordinary tuple (tuple) has a problem, that is, each time to get the elements with the subscript, you may not know the elements of this index representing what. namedtuple can be used to create a similar type of tuple, you can use the index to access the data, iteration, or can also access the data through the property name, making you  more convenient to use code:

The following uses the named tuples to represent the points in the coordinate system

```python
from collections import named tuple
Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
p = Point(10, 12)
p.x
10
p.y
12
```

#### 2.6.3 Counter

Counter is used to count the frequences of each element in an iterable object, taking a string as an example

```python
from collections import Counter
c = Counter('https://www.labex.io')
c
Counter({'w': 3, '/': 2, 't': 2, '.': 2, 'o': 1, 'x': 1, 'h': 1, 'p': 1, 'a': 1, 's': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 1, 'i': 1, ':': 1, 'b': 1})
```

Find the most frequently shown n elements

```python
c.most_common(3)
[('w', 3), ('/', 2), ('t', 2)]
```

## 3. Summary

There are too many modules in Python. We can not only rely on cramming but by the accumulation of experience. Generally, when project development process encounters some demands, first, search whether the Python has a ready-made module to deal with this demand. If there is, then use directly in the code and do not have to start them from the scratch.
