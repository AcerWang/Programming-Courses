# Implement Memory Leak Detector with C++

## 1. Introduction

Memory leak has always been one of the hardest problems, even for senior programers. Memory leak still proceeds when they get lapse sometimes. Besides the basic leak phenomenon of allocated memory, there are many different types of memory leak, such as exception branch leaking and etc. This project guides you to implement a memory leak detector.

#### Things to Learn

+ overwrite operator `new`
+ predefined macros `__FILE__` and `__LINE__`
+ static variables in headfile
+ smart pointer `std::shared_ptr`


### 2.1 Code Test

Memory leaks are usually relevant to the inadvertent allocated memory that unreleased. In modern operating systems, these unreleased memory will still be reclaimed by the operating system after the regular memory used by one application which is terminated, so a memory leak caused by a transient application will not cause serious consequences.

However, if we are writing an application such as a server, it will always be up and running. If there is logic leading to a memory leaking, there is a high possibility that it will continue increasing the leak of memory. Eventually, the performance of the system will be decreased and even cause operation failure.

A running program that continuously allocate memory is relatively simple:

```cpp
int main() {
    // allocates memory forever, never release
    while(1) int *a = new int;
    return 0;
}
```

To detect memory leaks in a running program, we usually set up checkpoints in the application to analyze whether the memory becames different with other checkpoints or not.
Essentially, it is similar to a short-term program memory leaking inspection. So the memory leak detector in this project will be implemented for a short-term memory leaks.

We hope the following test code can detect the memory leak. In this code, we don't release the allocated memory, and create a memory leak caused by exception branch:

```cpp
//
//  main.cpp
//  LeakDetector
//
#include <iostream>

// Implements memory leak inspection here
// #include "LeakDetector.hpp"

// testing exception branch leaking behavior
class Err {
public:
    Err(int n) {
        if(n == 0) throw 1000;
        data = new int[n];
    }
    ~Err() {
        delete[] data;
    }
private:
    int *data;
};

int main() {

    // Memory Leak: forget release pointer b
    int *a = new int;
    int *b = new int[12];

    delete a;

    // Memory Leak: 0 as constructor parameter causes exception leaking
    try {
        Err* e = new Err(0);
        delete e;
    } catch (int &ex) {
        std::cout << "Exception: " << ex << std::endl;
    };

    return 0;
}
```

We comment out the `#include "LeakDetector.hpp"` code snippet, then this code can be run normally, as is shown below. However, of course we know that it actually leads to memory leaks:

**The Result:**

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/Code/main.hpp
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "main.cpp" in /home/labex/Code/!
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.2 Design Memory Leak Detector

To achieve the memory leak detector, let's consider the following points:

1. Memory leaks are generated after the `new` operation has not been performed `delete`
2. The destructor of the first created object always excute at last

Then, we can perform the following actions corresponding to the two points above:

1. Overloaded `new` operator
2. Create a static object and call the destructor at the last of original program exit

The benefit of such two steps is that memory leak detection can be done without modifying the original code. Thus, we can write `LeakDetector.hpp`:

```cpp
//
//  /home/labex/Code/LeakDetector.hpp
//

#ifndef __LEAK_DETECTOR__
#define __LEAK_DETECTOR__

void* operator new(size_t _size, char *_file, unsigned int _line);
void* operator new[](size_t _size, char *_file, unsigned int _line);
// This macro will be described in LeakDetector.cpp
#ifndef __NEW_OVERLOAD_IMPLEMENTATION__
#define new	new(__FILE__, __LINE__)
#endif

class _leak_detector
{
public:
    static unsigned int callCount;
    _leak_detector() noexcept {
        ++callCount;
    }
    ~_leak_detector() noexcept {
        if (--callCount == 0)
            LeakDetector();
    }
private:
    static unsigned int LeakDetector() noexcept;
};
static _leak_detector _exit_counter;

#endif
```

Why design a `callCount`? The `callCount` ensures that our `LeakDetector` can only be invoked once. Consider the following simplified code snippet:

```cpp
// main.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "test.h"
int main () {
    return 0;
}
```
```cpp
// test.hpp
#include <iostream>
class Test {
public:
    static unsigned int count;
    Test () {
        ++count;
        std::cout << count << ",";
    }
};
static Test test;
```
```cpp
// test.cpp
#include "test.hpp"
unsigned int Test::count = 0;
```
The final outputs are `1, 2,`.
This is because the static variables in the header file are defined multiple times, and they will bedefined every time when they are included in a `.cpp` file (in our case, it will be included in `main.cpp` and `test.cpp`). Nevertheless, essentially they are the same object.

Now, the remaining question is: **How to implement memory leak detection?**

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/Code/LeakDetector.hpp
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "LeakDetector.hpp" in /home/labex/Code/!
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.3 Implement Memory Leak Detector

Let's implement our memory leak detector.

Since we have already overwrote the operator `new`, it is easy to think about manually managing memory allocation and releasing naturally. If our `delete` doesn't release all the allocated memory, then memory leak will happen. Now, the quesiton is: which structure should we use to manually manage memory?

Two-way linked list is a good option. For actual code, we don't know when we need to allocating memory, thus one-way linear list is not good enough, but a dynamic structure (linked list) will be much more convenience.
Moreover, one-way linked list is also not convience when deleting the object in memory leak detector.

Thus, two-way linked list is our best option at the moment:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

// Defining __NEW_OVERLOAD_IMPLEMENTATION__ macros,
// it prevents overwrite operator `new`
#define __NEW_OVERLOAD_IMPLEMENTATION__
#include "LeakDetector.hpp"

typedef struct _MemoryList {
    struct  _MemoryList *next, *prev;
    size_t 	size;       // size of allocated memory
    bool    isArray;    // either allocated array or not
    char    *file;      // locating leaking file
    unsigned int line;  // locating leaking line
} _MemoryList;
static unsigned long _memory_allocated = 0;     // saving unreleased memory size
static _MemoryList _root = {
    &_root, &_root,     // pointers of first element all pointing to itself
    0, false,           // 0 allocated memory size, not array
    NULL, 0             // no file, line 0
};

unsigned int _leak_detector::callCount = 0;
```

Now, let's manage allocated memory manually:

```cpp
// allocating memory starts from the head of _MemoryList
void* AllocateMemory(size_t _size, bool _array, char *_file, unsigned _line) {
    // calculate new size
    size_t newSize = sizeof(_MemoryList) + _size;

    // we can only use malloc for allocation since new has already been overwited.
    _MemoryList *newElem = (_MemoryList*)malloc(newSize);

    newElem->next = _root.next;
    newElem->prev = &_root;
    newElem->size = _size;
    newElem->isArray = _array;
    newElem->file = NULL;

    // save file info if exitsting
    if (_file) {
        newElem->file = (char *)malloc(strlen(_file)+1);
        strcpy(newElem->file, _file);
    }
    // save line number
    newElem->line = _line;

    // update list
    _root.next->prev = newElem;
    _root.next = newElem;

    // save to unreleased memory size
    _memory_allocated += _size;

    // return allocated memory
    return (char*)newElem + sizeof(_MemoryList);
}
```

and operator `delete` as well:

```cpp
void  DeleteMemory(void* _ptr, bool _array) {
    // back to the begining of MemoryList
    _MemoryList *currentElem = (_MemoryList *)((char *)_ptr - sizeof(_MemoryList));

    if (currentElem->isArray != _array) return;

    // update list
    currentElem->prev->next = currentElem->next;
    currentElem->next->prev = currentElem->prev;
    _memory_allocated -= currentElem->size;

    // release allocated memory for file information
    if (currentElem->file) free(currentElem->file);
    free(currentElem);
}
```

Considering we have two different ways to use `new` and `delete`:

```cpp
void* operator new(size_t _size) {
    return AllocateMemory(_size, false, NULL, 0);
}
void* operator new[](size_t _size) {
    return AllocateMemory(_size, true, NULL, 0);
}
void* operator new(size_t _size, char *_file, unsigned int _line) {
    return AllocateMemory(_size, false, _file, _line);
}
void* operator new[](size_t _size, char *_file, unsigned int _line) {
    return AllocateMemory(_size, true, _file, _line);
}
// overwrite operator delete
void operator delete(void *_ptr) noexcept {
    DeleteMemory(_ptr, false);
}
void operator delete[](void *_ptr) noexcept {
    DeleteMemory(_ptr, true);
}
```

Finally, we need to implement `_leak_detector::LeakDetector` and it will be called in the destructor of `static _leak_detector _exit_counter`, then every allocated objects will be released. The memory leaking appears in the case of `static _MemoryList _root` is not empty, and we only need to iterate `_root` to find where is the leak of memory:

```cpp
unsigned int _leak_detector::LeakDetector(void) noexcept {
    unsigned int count = 0;
    // iterates the whole list, if there is a memory leak,
    // then _LeakRoot.next alwasy doesn't pointing to itself
    _MemoryList *ptr = _root.next;
    while (ptr && ptr != &_root)
    {
        // output all leaking information
        if(ptr->isArray)
            std::cout << "Leaking[] ";
        else
            std::cout << "Leaking   ";
        std::cout << ptr << ", size of " << ptr->size;
        if (ptr->file)
            std::cout << " (located in " << ptr->file << ", line " << ptr->line << ")";
        else
            std::cout << " (no file info)";
        std::cout << std::endl;
    
        ++count;
        ptr = ptr->next;
    }

    if (count)
        std::cout << "Existing " << count << " memory leaking behavior, "<< _memory_allocated << " byte in total." << std::endl;
    return count;
}
```

Let's compile everything:

```bash
g++ main.cpp LeakDetector.cpp -std=c++11 -Wno-write-strings
```

In main.cpp, uncomment the `include "LeakDetector.hpp"`. Here is the expected output:


![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/L/W/T/V2NuYWzv4Fq2.png)

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'AllocateMemory' /home/labex/Code/LeakDetector.hpp
  error: Oops, we find that you didn't define method "AllocateMemory()" in "LeakDetector.hpp".
  timeout: 2
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'DeleteMemory' /home/labex/Code/LeakDetector.hpp
  error: Oops, we find that you didn't define method "DeleteMemory()" in "LeakDetector.hpp".
  timeout: 2
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'new' /home/labex/Code/LeakDetector.hpp
  error: Oops, we find that you didn't define method "new()" in "LeakDetector.hpp".
  timeout: 2
```

## 3. Summary

In this experiment, we overwrite the operator `new` in C++, and implement a memory leak detector.
In fact, the code can also be used for the smart pointer circular reference leaking. We only need to change `main.cpp` as following:

```cpp
#include <memory> // use smart pointer

// no changes at the begining as previous in main.cpp

// add two testing class
class A;
class B;
class A {
public:
    std::shared_ptr<B> p;
};
class B {
public:
    std::shared_ptr<A> p;
};

int main() {

    // changes here as previous in main.cpp

    // additional cases, use smart pointer
    auto smartA = std::make_shared<A>();
    auto smartB = std::make_shared<B>();
    smartA->p = smartB;
    smartB->p = smartA;

    return 0;

}
```

Our final outputs are:
