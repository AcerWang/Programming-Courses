# Learn Blockchains by Building One

*The fastest way to learn how Blockchains work is to build one*

##1. Introduction

You’re here because, you’re psyched about the rise of Cryptocurrencies. And you want to know how Blockchains work—the fundamental technology behind them. But understanding Blockchains isn’t easy—or at least isn’t for a beginner. Long time ago, We trudged through dense videos, followed porous tutorials, and dealt with the amplified frustration of too few examples.

We like learning by doing. It forces you to deal with the subject matter at a code level, which gets it sticking. If you do the same, at the end of this guide you’ll have a functioning Blockchain with a solid grasp of how they work.

### *Preparation: Before you get started…*

Remember that a blockchain is an *immutable, sequential* chain of records called Blocks. They can contain transactions, files or any data you like, really. But the important thing is that they’re *chained* together using *hashes*. If you aren’t sure what a hash is, [here’s an explanation](https://learncryptography.com/hash-functions/what-are-hash-functions).

**Who is this guide aimed at?**
You should be comfy reading and writing some basic Python, as well as have some understanding of how HTTP requests work, since we’ll be talking to our Blockchain over HTTP.

**What do you need to begin?**

Make sure that [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (along with `pip`) is installed. You’ll also need to install [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and the wonderful [Requests](http://www.python-requests.org/en/master/) library:

```
 pip3 install Flask==0.12.2 requests==2.18.4 
```

Oh, you’ll also need an HTTP Client, like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) or cURL. But anything will do.

### Building a Blockchain

Open up your favourite text editor or IDE, personally I love [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). Create a new file, called `blockchain.py`. We’ll only use a single file, but if you get lost, you can always refer to the [source code](https://github.com/dvf/blockchain).

#### Representing a Blockchain

We’ll create a `Blockchain` class whose constructor creates an initial empty list (to store our blockchain), and another to store transactions. Here’s the blueprint for our class:

```
class Blockchain(object):
    def __init__(self):
    	# chain is used for the blockchain
        self.chain = []
        # currenr_transactions is used for transactions
        self.current_transactions = []
        
    def new_block(self):
        # Creates a new Block and adds it to the chain
        pass
    
    def new_transaction(self):
        # Adds a new transaction to the list of transactions
        pass
    
    @staticmethod
    def hash(block):
        # Hashes a Block
        pass

    @property
    def last_block(self):
        # Returns the last Block in the chain
        pass
```

Our `Blockchain` class is responsible for managing the chain. It will store transactions and have some  helper methods for adding new blocks to the chain. Let’s start fleshing out some methods.

#### What does a Block look like?

Each block has an *index*, a *timestamp* (in Unix time), a *list of transactions*, a *proof* (more on that later), and the *hash of the previous block*. Here’s an example of what a single Block looks like:

```
block = {
    'index': 1,
    'timestamp': 1506057125.900785,
    'transactions': [
        {
            'sender': "8527147fe1f5426f9dd545de4b27ee00",
            'recipient': "a77f5cdfa2934df3954a5c7c7da5df1f",
            'amount': 5,
        }
    ],
    'proof': 324984774000,
    'previous_hash': "2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824"
}
```

At this point, the idea of a *chain* should be apparent—each new block contains within itself, the hash of the previous Block. **This is crucial because it’s what gives blockchains immutability:** If an attacker corrupted an earlier Block in the chain then all subsequent blocks will contain incorrect hashes.

*Does this make sense? If it doesn’t, take some time to let it sink in—it’s the core idea behind blockchains.*

#### Adding Transactions to a Block

We’ll need a way of adding transactions to a Block. Our `new_transaction()` method is responsible for this, and it’s pretty straight-forward:

```
class Blockchain(object):
    ...
    
    def new_transaction(self, sender, recipient, amount):
        """
        Creates a new transaction to go into the next mined Block
        :param sender: <str> Address of the Sender
        :param recipient: <str> Address of the Recipient
        :param amount: <int> Amount
        :return: <int> The index of the Block that will hold this transaction
        """

        self.current_transactions.append({
            'sender': sender,
            'recipient': recipient,
            'amount': amount,
        })
        return self.last_block['index'] + 1
```

After `new_transaction()` adds a transaction to the list, it returns the *index* of the block which the transaction will be added to—*the next one to be mined.* This will be useful later on, to the user submitting the transaction.

#### Creating new Blocks

When our `Blockchain` is instantiated we’ll need to seed it with a *genesis* block—a block with no predecessors. We’ll also need to add a *“proof”* to our genesis block which is the result of mining (or proof of work). We’ll talk more about mining later. In addition to creating the *genesis* block in our constructor, we’ll also flesh out the methods for `new_block()`, `new_transaction()` and `hash()` :

```
import hashlib
import json
from time import time


class Blockchain(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_transactions = []
        self.chain = []

        # Create the genesis block
        self.new_block(previous_hash=1, proof=100)

    def new_block(self, proof, previous_hash=None):
        """
        Create a new Block in the Blockchain
        :param proof: <int> The proof given by the Proof of Work algorithm
        :param previous_hash: (Optional) <str> Hash of previous Block
        :return: <dict> New Block
        """

        block = {
            'index': len(self.chain) + 1,
            'timestamp': time(),
            'transactions': self.current_transactions,
            'proof': proof,
            'previous_hash': previous_hash or self.hash(self.chain[-1]),
        }

        # Reset the current list of transactions
        self.current_transactions = []

        self.chain.append(block)
        return block

    def new_transaction(self, sender, recipient, amount):
        """
        Creates a new transaction to go into the next mined Block
        :param sender: <str> Address of the Sender
        :param recipient: <str> Address of the Recipient
        :param amount: <int> Amount
        :return: <int> The index of the Block that will hold this transaction
        """
        self.current_transactions.append({
            'sender': sender,
            'recipient': recipient,
            'amount': amount,
        })

        return self.last_block['index'] + 1

    @property
    def last_block(self):
        return self.chain[-1]

    @staticmethod
    def hash(block):
        """
        Creates a SHA-256 hash of a Block
        :param block: <dict> Block
        :return: <str>
        """

        # We must make sure that the Dictionary is Ordered, or we'll have inconsistent hashes
        block_string = json.dumps(block, sort_keys=True).encode()
        return hashlib.sha256(block_string).hexdigest()
```

The above should be straight-forward—We’ve added some comments and *docstrings* to help keep it clear. We’re almost done with representing our blockchain. But at this point, you must be wondering how new blocks are created, forged or mined.

#### Understanding Proof of Work

A Proof of Work algorithm (PoW) is how new Blocks are created or *mined* on the blockchain*.* The goal of PoW is to discover a number which solves a problem. The number must be **difficult to find** **but easy to verify**—computationally speaking—by anyone on the network. This is the core idea behind Proof of Work.

We’ll look at a very simple example to help this sink in. 

Let’s decide that the *hash* of some integer `x` multiplied by another `y` must end in `0`. So, `hash(x * y) = ac23dc...0`. And for this simplified example, let’s fix `x = 5`. Implementing this in Python:

```
from hashlib import sha256

x = 5
y = 0  # We don't know what y should be yet...

while sha256(str(x*y).encode()).hexdigest()[-1] != "0":
    y += 1

print('The solution is y =',y)
```

The solution here is `y = 21`. Since, the produced hash ends in `0`:

```
hash(5 * 21) = 1253e9373e...5e3600155e860
```

In Bitcoin, the Proof of Work algorithm is called [*Hashcash*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash). And it’s not too different from our basic example above. It’s the algorithm that miners race to solve in order to create a new block. In general, the difficulty is determined by the number of characters searched for in a string. The miners are then rewarded for their 
solution by receiving a coin—in a transaction. The network is able to *easily* verify their solution.

#### Implementing basic Proof of Work

Let’s implement a similar algorithm for our blockchain. Our rule will be similar to the example above:

> *Find a number* **p** *that when hashed with the previous block’s solution a hash with 4 leading* `0`*s is produced.*

```
import hashlib
import json

from time import time
from uuid import uuid4

class Blockchain(object):
    ...
        
    def proof_of_work(self, last_proof):
        """
        Simple Proof of Work Algorithm:
         - Find a number p' such that hash(pp') contains leading 4 zeroes,
         where p is the previous p'
         - p is the previous proof, and p' is the new proof
        :param last_proof: <int>
        :return: <int>
        """

        proof = 0
        while self.valid_proof(last_proof, proof) is False:
            proof += 1

        return proof

    @staticmethod
    def valid_proof(last_proof, proof):
        """
        Validates the Proof: Does hash(last_proof, proof) contain 4 leading zeroes?
        :param last_proof: <int> Previous Proof
        :param proof: <int> Current Proof
        :return: <bool> True if correct, False if not.
        """

        guess = (str(last_proof)+str(proof)).encode()
        guess_hash = hashlib.sha256(guess).hexdigest()
        return guess_hash[:4] == "0000" 
```

To adjust the difficulty of the algorithm, we could modify the number of leading zeroes. But 4 is sufficient. You’ll find out that the addition of a single leading zero makes a mammoth difference to the time required to find a solution.

You can create a object to test your blockchain works, like this:

```
...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    block = Blockchain()
    s = block.hash("abc123")
    print(s)
```
