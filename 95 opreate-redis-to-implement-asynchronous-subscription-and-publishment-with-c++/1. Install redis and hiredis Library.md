# Install redis and hiredis Library

## 1.Introduction

Before starting this course, you might as well learn the basic Redis course. Learn the basic ways to use Redis and try to operate it first. Redis（Remote Dictionary Server) is a key-value storage system written by Salvatore Sanfilippo. Usually, Redis is called a data structure server, because value can be `string`, `map`, `list`, `sets` and `sorted sets`. It has a high performance, fast speed of reading and writing and abundant data types. Additionally, it supports atomic execution after combining multiple operations, and features like publish/subscribe and informing users of the overdue `Key`. 

#### 1.1 Knowledge Points

- Basic knowledge of Redis
- Install and use Redis
- Install hiredis library, and write the test program.

## 2. Install and Run Redis

You can install Redis by the source code or apt-get. Use the following commands while installing Redis in the environment:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install redis-server
```

Launch Redis

```shell
redis-server     
```

Check if Redis is successfully launched launched

```shell
$ sudo service redis-server start
$ redis-cli   #Open another shell
```

## 3. Install and Use hiredis Library

hiredis is the c/c++ Redis Client Library released by the official. You can find thre source code in github. Let's learn how to install hiredis library.

### 3.1 Install hiredis

Just run the following commands to finish your installment:

```shell
wget https://labexfile.oss-us-west-1-internal.aliyuncs.com/courses/95/hiredis-master.zip
unzip hiredis-master.zip
cd hiredis-master  
make  
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib  #ldconfig is a dynamic link library management command. Copy the generated library to catalogue /usr/local/lib.
```

### 3.2 Sync the Related API

There're some important functions for you to know while I'm introducing the synchronous API.

- redisContext * redisConnect(const char * ip, int port);    
- void * redisCommand(redisContext * c, const char * format, ...); 
- void freeReplyObject(void * reply); 

#### 3.2.1 Connect the Related Functions

The function `redisConnect` is used to create `redisContext` object. Context needs Hiredis to keep being connected. While running into a connection problem, there's an `err` non-zero integer in the `redisContext` structure to mark the error, and the `errstr` while describe the error information. Error section contains more error information. So while trying to use `redisConnect` to connect to the server, you should check if the connection is successful in `err` data segment. Pay attention, `redisContext` is not thread-safe.

Example：

```cpp
redisContext *c = redisConnect("127.0.0.1", 6379);
if (c == NULL || c->err) {
    if (c) {
        printf("Error: %s\n", c->errstr);
        // handle error
    } else {
        printf("Can't allocate redis context\n");
    }
}
```

#### 3.2.2 Send the Related Commands

There're some ways to send commands to the Redis server. `redisCommand` is quite similar to `printf`:

```cpp
reply = redisCommand(context, "SET foo bar");
```

Placeholder `%s` means a  string ，you can use `strlen` to get the length of the string.

```cpp
reply = redisCommand(context, "SET foo %s", value);
```

Placeholder `%b` means the command of binary system. Beside the pointer that points at `string`, you also need a data named `size_t` to indicate the length of `string`.

```cpp
reply = redisCommand(context, "SET foo %b", value, (size_t) valuelen);
```

There's a quicker way to operate Redis:

```cpp
reply = redisCommand(context, "SET key:%s %s", myid, value);
```

#### 3.2.3 Cleaning

Use the function below to disconnect and release `context`.

```cpp
void redisFree(redisContext *c);
```

#### 3.2.4 Common Errors

`REDIS_ERR_IO`: While reading or writing the connection, there's an I/O error. If the program contains `errno.h` head file, you can use global variable `errno` to find where the error is.

`REDIS_ERR_EOF`: The reading result will be empty when you disconnect to the server.

`REDIS_ERR_PROTOCOL`: There's an error while parsing the protocol.

`REDIS_ERR_OTHER`: Other kinds of mistakes. You can get the error information by `errstr`.

### 3.3 Async the Related API

Hiredis can implement asyncing API by other event libraries. The examples below all use [libev](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html) and [libevent](http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/).

#### 3.3.1 Connect to the Related Functions

`redisAsyncConnect` can be used to create a non-blocking connection to Redis, and its return value is a pointer `redisAsyncContext` structure. The variable  `err` is used to check whether there's a problem in the server-side. As the created connection is non-blocking, `kernel` can't return whether the connection is successful. `redisAsyncContext`  is not thread-safe.

```cpp
redisAsyncContext *c = redisAsyncConnect("127.0.0.1", 6379);
if (c->err) {
    printf("Error: %s\n", c->errstr);
    // handle error
}
```

The asynchronous `context` has a callback function for disconnection to get the related information while disconnecting. Here's its prototype:

```cpp
void(const redisAsyncContext *c, int status);
```

#### 3.3.2 Sending Commands and Their Callback

Being different from syncing API, in the asynchronous mode, there's only one way to send commands. And because it's asynchronous, so you need a callback function to check whether the commands are successfully sent after you send them.

```cpp
void(redisAsyncContext *c, void *reply, void *privdata);
```

The functions below send commands in the asynchronous way:

```cpp
int redisAsyncCommand(
  redisAsyncContext *ac, redisCallbackFn *fn, void *privdata,
  const char *format, ...);
int redisAsyncCommandArgv(
  redisAsyncContext *ac, redisCallbackFn *fn, void *privdata,
  int argc, const char **argv, const size_t *argvlen);
```

#### 3.3.3 Disconnection

The asynchronous connection will get disconnected by this way:

```cpp
void redisAsyncDisconnect(redisAsyncContext *ac);
```

While invoking this function, the connection won't be ended immediately, and the new command won't be received. In the connection, all the former commands will be written after `socket`, and the connection will be ended after getting the returned reply. At this time, `disconnection` callback function will return `REDIS_OK`, and release the object.

### 3.4 Write the Test Code

````sh
vim /home/labex/test.cpp
````

The code of test.cpp as below.

```cpp
#include <hiredis/hiredis.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    struct timeval timeout = {2, 0};    //Timeout for 2s

    redisContext *pRedisContext = (redisContext*)redisConnectWithTimeout("127.0.0.1", 6379, timeout);    //redisContext is the operation object of Redis
    if ( (NULL == pRedisContext) || (pRedisContext->err) )
    {
        if (pRedisContext)
        {
            std::cout << "connect error:" << pRedisContext->errstr << std::endl;
        }
        else
        {
            std::cout << "connect error: can't allocate redis context." << std::endl;
        }
        return -1;
    }
    //redisReply is command reply object of Redis, the information that Redis returned is saved in redisReply object.
    redisReply *pRedisReply = (redisReply*)redisCommand(pRedisContext, "INFO");  //execute INFO command，you can see what's going o n with Redis in details
    std::cout << pRedisReply->str << std::endl;
    //When multiple Redis commands use the same redisReply object
    //Everytime after executing Redis command, you need to clean redisReply to avoid influencing the next Redis operation
    freeReplyObject(pRedisReply);   

    return 0;
}
```

Run：

```sh
sudo redis-server    #Start a shell execution command individually
g++ test.cpp -o test -lhiredis
./test                
```

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/test.cpp
  Error: Oops! We find that you didn't create file "test.cpp" in "/home/labex/".
```

## 4. Summary 

In this course, we've learned how to install and use Redis. Besides, we use hiredis library to write a test program, execute INFO command to get information about Redis server. Redis has abundant functions.Except nosql, it has great disaster recovery capability. In assigned interval, RDB persistence can generate the point-in-time snapshot of data sets. AOF persistence records all the writing operation commands that the server executes. In the next course, we'll implement a program of asynchronous subscription and releasing.
