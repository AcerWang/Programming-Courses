# Basic--values & variables & constant

## 1. Introduction

Go is an open source programming language designed for building simple, fast, and reliable software. Go by Example is a hands-on introduction to Go using annotated example programs. In this part, you'll learn some basic golang syntax which is a little different from other programming languages you may have learnt and you'll have a overview about golang program.

#### Learning Objectives

- values
- basic data types
- variables
- constant

### 2.1 The First Program

Our first program will print the classic "hello world" message. Here's the full source code.
Write the following code in `hello-world.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
/*
 * this is your first program of golang
 * this is a block comment
*/
package main

import "fmt"

// this is a single line comment

func main() {   // the brace must be in the same line with the function name
	// print a string: hello world
	fmt.Println("hello world")
} 
```

The golang's syntax is a little different from many other language like Java and C++, you may notice that there's no semicolons to ending each line in the program. In golang, we organize code by packages, you can write code in different files with the same package name, which means they are parts of the same package just locating diffrtently. We use `import` to include the standard libs or customized libs so as to make use of methods they provide, the imported module is surrounded by double quotes. The key word `func` is used to declare a function. The main function is  the only entry for a program.

To run the program, put the code in `hello-world.go` and use `go run`. Sometimes we'll want to build our programs into binaries. We can do this using `go build`. We can then execute the built binary directly. 

**Output:**

```
$ go run hello-world.go
hello world

$ go build hello-world.go
$ ls
hello-world	hello-world.go

$ ./hello-world
hello world
```

Now that we can run and build basic Go programs, let's learn more about the language.

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/Code/hello-world.go
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "hello-world.go" in /home/labex/Code!
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.2 Values

Go has various value types including strings, integers, floats, booleans, complex and some other advanced data types. The basic data types in Go include numeric and boolean types. The numbers mainly include integers, float-point numbers and complex numbers. For numeric values, the operations mostly include these:

| operators | description    |
| --------- | -------------- |
| +         | addition       |
| -         | subtraction    |
| *         | multiplication |
| /         | division       |
| %         | remainder      |

For booleans, the operators are:

| operators | description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| &&        | and         |
| &#124;&#124;      | or          |
| !         | not         |

The built-in numberic types are listed here:

| Type       | Range                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| byte       | synonym for uint8                        |
| int        | int32 or int64 depending on the os       |
| int8       | [−128, 127]                              |
| int16      | [−32768, 32767]                          |
| int32      | [−2147483648, 2147483647]                |
| int64      | [−9223372036854775808, 9223372036854775807] |
| rune       | synonym for int32                        |
| uint       | uint32 or uint64 depending on the os     |
| uint8      | [0, 255]                                 |
| uint16     | [0, 65535]                               |
| uint32     | [0, 4294967295]                          |
| uint64     | [0, 18446744073709551615]                |
| float32    | accurate to about 7 decimal places       |
| float64    | accurate to about 15 decimal places      |
| complex64  | the real and imaginary parts are both of type float32 |
| complex128 | the real and imaginary parts are both of type float64 |

Golang keep pointer, but it's safer and easier than that in C and C++, the operations are: 

| operation | description                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| &x        | get the reference for  variable x        |
| *x        | get the content of what pointer x refers to |

The strings in golang are different from other languages, string by default is encoded with utf-8. Here are some common use of string.

| syntax          | description                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| s += s1         | append string s1 to the end of string s  |
| s + s1          | concatenation of strings s and t         |
| s[i]            | the raw byte at index position i (of type uint8) in s |
| s[n:m]          | a string taken from s from index positions n to m - 1 |
| s[n:]           | a string taken from s from index positions n to the end |
| s[:m]           | a string taken from s from index positions 0 to m - 1 |
| len(s)          | the number of bytes in string s          |
| string(chars)   | convert a []rune or []int32 into a string |
| string(i)       | convert i of any integer type into a string |
| string(bytes)   | convert a []byte or []uint8 into a string without copying |
| []byte(s)       | convert string s into a slice of raw bytes without copying |
| fmt.Sprint(x)   | the string representation of x of any type |
| strconv.Itoa(i) | the string representation of i of type int and an error, e.g if i is 65, it returns ("65", nil) |

Here are a few basic examples. Write the following code in `values.go` in `/home/labex.Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// concatenate two strings
    fmt.Println("go" + "lang")
	
	// numeric operations
    fmt.Println("1+1 =", 1+1)
    fmt.Println("7.0/3.0 =", 7.0/3.0)
    
    // boolean operations
    fmt.Println(true && false)
    fmt.Println(true || false)
    fmt.Println(!true)
    
    // x is type of complex128, the same as -3+4i
    x := complex(-3, 4)
    fmt.Println(x,real(x),imag(x))
    
    // pointer operation
    var a = 1
    var p = &a
    fmt.Println("a = ",*p)
}
```

Strings, which can be added together with `+`. Booleans, with boolean operators as you'd expect.

**Output:**

```
$ go run values.go
golang
1+1 = 2
7.0/3.0 = 2.3333333333333335
false
true
false
(-3+4i) -3 4
a = 1
```

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/Code/values.go
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "values.go" in /home/labex/Code!
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.3 Variables

In Go, *variables* are explicitly declared and used by the compiler to check type-correctness of function calls. Write the following code in `variables.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // declare a string variable
    var a = "initial"
    fmt.Println(a)
    // declare two int variables
    var b, c int = 1, 2
    fmt.Println(b, c)
    // declare a boolean variable
    var d = true
    fmt.Println(d)
    
    // declare an int variable with default zero-valued
    var e int
    fmt.Println(e)
    
    // the shorthand declaration of variable
    f := "short"
    fmt.Println(f)
       
    // declare mutiple variables of different types
    var (   // the parenthese must be in the same line with the key word
     	g = 5		// g type of int
    	 h = true     // h type of boolean
     	i = 3.2      // i type of float64
    )
    fmt.Println(g,h,i)
   }
```
`var` declares 1 or more variables. You can declare multiple variables at once. Go will infer the type of initialized variables. Variables declared without a corresponding initialization are *zero-valued*. For example, the zero value for an `int` is `0`. The `:=` syntax is shorthand for declaring and initializing a variable, e.g. for `var f string = "short"` in this case.

**Output:**

```
$ go run variables.go
initial
1 2
true
0
short
5 true 3.2
```

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/Code/variables.go
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "variables.go" in /home/labex/Code!
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.4 Constant

Go supports *constants* of character, string, boolean, and numeric values. constant variables can not be changed after its first declaration. You cann't assign a variable to a const since const is determinated at compile time. Write the following code in `constant.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "math"
    
// here, s is a global constant value
const s string = "constant"
    
func main() {
    fmt.Println(s)
    	
    // n and d are two local constant values
    const n = 500000000
    const d = 3e20 / n
    fmt.Println(d)
    fmt.Println(int64(d))
    fmt.Println(math.Sin(n))
    
    fmt.Println(math.Pi)
    
    // When declared a group of consts, the right-hand side expression may be 
    // omitted for all but the first of the group, implying that the previous 
    // expression and its type should be used again.
    // the iota is used for variables to increase value by 1 if not assign values
    const (     // the parenthese must be in the same line with the key word
         w = 1
         x 
         y = iota
         z
    )
    fmt.Println(w,x,y,z)
}
```
`const` declares a constant value. A `const` statement can appear anywhere a `var` statement can. Constant expressions perform arithmetic with arbitrary precision. A numeric constant has no type until it’s given one, such as by an explicit cast. A number can be given a type by using it in a context that requires one, such as a variable assignment or function call. For example, here `math.Sin` expects a `float64`.

**Output:**

```
$ go run constant.go 
constant
6e+11
600000000000
-0.28470407323754404
3.141592653589793
1 1 2 3
```

    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/Code/constant.go
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "constant.go" in /home/labex/Code!
  timeout: 3
```

## 3. Summary
