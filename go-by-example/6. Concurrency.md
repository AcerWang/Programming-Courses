# Concurrency

## 1. Introduction

In previous experiments, you have learnt an important feature - *interface*. Now, you will see another important design in Go - *concurrency*. What distinguishes Go from other programming language maybe is its concurrency mechanism. In golang, you can write concurrent programs easily using gorountines with no need for much experience, the goroutines are light-weighted and can be created massively with very little performance consumption. With channels, communication between goroutines is simple, synchronization of different goroutines is easy to achieve.

### 2.1 Goroutines

In previous learning, we only write programs of single thread, that means when you invoke a function, you must wait the function executing to the end and returning, then you can execute subsequent code. Some functions are time-consuming, so wait them to finish meanwhile you can do nothing, this is not a good idea. How can we make use of the high performance of our computers to do different tasks simultaneously like the operation system does in golang? Let's see the goroutines.

A *goroutine* is a light-weighted thread of execution. Suppose we have a function call `f(s)`. Here's how we'd call that in the usual way, running it synchronously. To invoke this function in a goroutine, use the keyword `go`. When running to the `main` function, the Go runtime start a goroutine seem like the main thread in other language. When get to the `go f(s)` , the runtime will start a new goroutine, this new goroutine will execute concurrently with the calling one. You can also start a goroutine for an anonymous function call. Our two function calls are running asynchronously in separate goroutines now, so execution falls through to here. As the goroutines are synchronous, maybe the main goroutine finishes before the sub goroutines, in this case we can not see the whole result, this is why we call the `fmt.Scanln` in main function waiting for us to press a key before the program exits. Write the following code in `goroutines.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main
	
import "fmt"

func f(from string) {
	// print some message repetitively
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        fmt.Println(from, ":", i)
    }
}

func main() {

	// call the function in a procedural way
	f("direct")
	
	// call the function synchronously
	// it will run in a new goroutine
	go f("goroutine")
	
	// in a new goroutine, print a string to the stdout
	go func(msg string) {
        fmt.Println(msg)
    }("going")
    
    // wait for user to input
    fmt.Scanln()
    fmt.Println("done")
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run goroutines.go
direct : 0
direct : 1
direct : 2
goroutine : 0
going
goroutine : 1
goroutine : 2
<enter>
done
```

When we run this program, we see the output of the blocking call first, then the interleaved output of the two goroutines. This interleaving reflects the goroutines being run concurrently by the Go runtime. Next we'll look at a complement to goroutines in concurrent Go programs: channels.

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/Code/goroutines.go
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "goroutines.go" in /home/labex/Code!
  timeout: 3
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'go\s\w+\(.*\)' /home/labex/Code/goroutines.go
  error: Oops, we find that you didn't use goroutine like "go func_name(xxx)" in "goroutines.go".
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.2 Channels

*Channels* are the pipes that connect different concurrent goroutines. You can send values into channels from one goroutine and receive those values into another goroutine. Create a new channel with `make(chan val-type)`. Channels are typed by the values they convey. *Send* a value into a channel using the `channel <- value` syntax. Here we send `"ping"` to the `messages` channel we made above, from a new goroutine. The `<-channel` syntax *receives* a value from the channel. Here we'll receive the `"ping"` message we sent above and print it out. When we run the program the `"ping"` message is successfully passed from one goroutine to another via our channel. By default, sends and receives block until both the sender and receiver are ready. This property allowed us to wait at the end of our program for the `"ping"` message without having to use any other synchronization. Write the following code in `channels.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	// use make to create a bidirectional unbuffered channel
	// this channel can be used to both send and receive values
	messages := make(chan string)
	
	// for unbuffered channel, when first uses it,
	// it immediately blocks the program 
	// waiting for another goroutine get ready to send or receive
	go func() {
		// send a string to the channel
		messages <- "ping" 
	}()
	
	// if this code below is before the `go func` called, there would be an error
	// receive value from the channel
	msg := <-messages
	
    fmt.Println(msg)
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run channels.go 
ping
```

#### 2.2.1 Channel Buffering

By default channels are *unbuffered*, meaning that they will only accept sends (`chan <-`) if there is a corresponding receive (`<- chan`) ready to receive the sent value. *Buffered channels* accept a limited number of values without a corresponding receiver for those values. Here we `make` a channel of strings buffering up to 2 values.  Because this channel is buffered, we can send these values into the channel without a corresponding concurrent receive. Later we can receive these two values as usual. Write the following code in `channel-buffering.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  	
  	// create a buffered channel with capacity of 2
  	messages := make(chan string, 2)
  	
  	// send two string values to the channel
  	messages <- "buffered"
    messages <- "channel"
    
    // print the received values from the channel
    fmt.Println(<-messages)
    fmt.Println(<-messages)
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run channel-buffering.go 
buffered
channel
```

#### 2.2.2 Channel Synchronization

We can use channels to synchronize execution across goroutines. Here's an example of using a blocking receive to wait for a goroutine to finish. This is the function we'll run in a goroutine. The `done`channel will be used to notify another goroutine that this function's work is done. Send a value to notify that we're done. Start a worker goroutine, giving it the channel to notify on. Block until we receive a notification from the worker on the channel. If you removed the `<- done` line from this program, the program would exit before the `worker` even started. Write the following code in `channel-synchronization.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "time"

func worker(done chan bool) {
  	fmt.Print("working...")
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
    fmt.Println("done")
    
    done <- true
}

func main() {
	
	// make a buffered channel with capacity of 1
  	done := make(chan bool, 1)
  	// call `worker` synchronously
    go worker(done)
    
    // wait `worker` get done
    <-done
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run channel-synchronization.go      
working...done 
```

#### 2.2.3 Channel Directions

When using channels as function parameters, you can specify if a channel is meant to only send or receive values. This specificity increases the type-safety of the program. This `ping` function only accepts a channel for sending values. It would be a compile-time error to try to receive on this channel. The `pong` function accepts one channel for receives (`pings`) and a second for sends (`pongs`). Write the following code in `channel-directions.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func ping(pings chan<- string, msg string) {
    pings <- msg
}

func pong(pings <-chan string, pongs chan<- string) {
    msg := <-pings
    pongs <- msg
}

func main() {
    pings := make(chan string, 1)
    pongs := make(chan string, 1)
    ping(pings, "passed message")
    pong(pings, pongs)
    fmt.Println(<-pongs)
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run channel-directions.go
passed message
```

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/Code/channel-directions.go
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "channel-directions.go" in /home/labex/Code!
  timeout: 3
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'chan' /home/labex/Code/channel-directions.go
  error: Oops, we find that you didn't use channel "chan" in "channel-directions.go".
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.3 Select

Go's *select* lets you wait on multiple channel operations. Combining goroutines and channels with select is a powerful feature of Go. For our example we'll select across two channels. Each channel will receive a value after some amount of time, to simulate e.g. blocking RPC operations executing in concurrent goroutines. We'll use `select` to await both of these values simultaneously, printing each one as it arrives. We receive the values `"one"` and then `"two"` as expected. Note that the total execution time is only ~2 seconds since both the 1 and 2 second `Sleeps` execute concurrently. Write the following code in `select.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "time"
import "fmt"

func main() {

	c1 := make(chan string)
    c2 := make(chan string)
    
    go func() {
        time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
        c1 <- "one"
    }()
    
    go func() {
        time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
        c2 <- "two"
    }()
    
    for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
        select {
        case msg1 := <-c1:
            fmt.Println("received", msg1)
        case msg2 := <-c2:
            fmt.Println("received", msg2)
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ time go run select.go
received one
received two
```

    grep -i 'select' /home/labex/Code/select.go
  error: Oops, we find that you didn't use keyword "select" in "select.go".
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.4 Non-Blocking Channel Operations

Basic sends and receives on channels are blocking. However, we can use `select` with a `default` clause to implement *non-blocking* sends, receives, and even *non-blocking* multi-way `select`s. Here's a non-blocking receive. If a value is available on `messages` then `select` will take the `<-messages` `case` with that value. If not, it will immediately take the `default` case. A non-blocking send works similarly. Here `msg` can not be sent to the `messages` channel, because the channel has no buffer and there is no receiver. Therefore the `default` case is selected. We can use multiple `case`s above the `default` clause to implement a multi-way non-blocking select. Here we attempt non-blocking receives on both `messages` and `signals`. Write the following code in `non-block-channel.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	
    messages := make(chan string)
    signals := make(chan bool)
    
    // no message get ready, select the default
    select {
        case msg := <-messages:
            fmt.Println("received message", msg)
        default:
            fmt.Println("no message received")
    }
    
    msg := "hi"
    // no message get ready, select the default
    select {
        case messages <- msg:
            fmt.Println("sent message", msg)
        default:
            fmt.Println("no message sent")
    }
    
    // no message/signal get ready, select the default
    select {
        case msg := <-messages:
            fmt.Println("received message", msg)
        case sig := <-signals:
            fmt.Println("received signal", sig)
        default:
            fmt.Println("no activity")
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run non-block-channel.go 
no message received
no message sent
no activity
```

  timeout: 3
```

### 2.5 Closing Channels

*Closing* a channel indicates that no more values will be sent on it. This can be useful to communicate completion to the channel's receivers. In this example we'll use a `jobs` channel to communicate 'work' to be done from the `main()` goroutine to a worker goroutine. When we have no more jobs for the worker, we'll `close` the `jobs` channel. Here's the worker goroutine. It repeatedly receives from `jobs` with `j, more := <-jobs`. In this special 2-value form of receive, the `more` value will be `false` if `jobs` has been closed and all values in the channel have already been received. We use this to notify on `done` when we've worked all our jobs. This sends 3 jobs to the worker over the `jobs` channel, then closes it. We await the worker using the synchronization approach we saw earlier. The idea of closed channels leads naturally to our next example: `range` over channels. Write the following code in `closing-channels.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    
    // create two chanel, one buffered channel, one unbuffered channel
    jobs := make(chan int, 5)
    done := make(chan bool)
    
    // call the anonymous function synchronously
    go func() {
        for {
        	// receive job from channel
        	// if no more jobs, more will be set false
            j, more := <-jobs
            if more {
                fmt.Println("received job", j)
            } else {
                fmt.Println("received all jobs")
                // no more jobs, send a message to main goroutine
                done <- true
                return
            }
        }
     }()
    
    for j := 1; j <= 3; j++ {
        jobs <- j
        fmt.Println("sent job", j)
    }
    close(jobs)
    fmt.Println("sent all jobs")
    
    // blocking, waiting message get ready
    <-done
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run closing-channels.go 
sent job 1
received job 1
sent job 2
received job 2
sent job 3
received job 3
sent all jobs
received all jobs
```

    #!/bin/bash

    grep -i 'close' /home/labex/Code/closing-channels.go
  error: Oops, we find that you didn't close channel "close()" in "closing-channels.go".
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.6 Range over Channels

In a previous example we saw how `for` and `range` provide iteration over basic data structures. We can also use this syntax to iterate over values received from a channel. We'll iterate over 2 values in the `queue` channel. This `range` iterates over each element as it's received from `queue`. Because we `close`d the channel above, the iteration terminates after receiving the 2 elements. This example also showed that it's possible to close a non-empty channel but still have the remaining values be received. Write the following code in `range-over-channels.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	
	// create a channel with capacity of 2
	queue := make(chan string, 2)
	
	// send two string to the channel
    queue <- "one"
    queue <- "two"
    
    // close the channel
    close(queue)
    
    // iterate the closed channel, get its elements
    for elem := range queue {
        fmt.Println(elem)
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run range-over-channels.go
one
two
```

## 3. Summary

Concurrency  is a powerful tool for all programming languages. But in many others, in order to write well designed concurrent programs, programmers must to use locks explicitly which has some pitfall difficult to operate. In golang, the designer do all the difficult task for us, so we can use goroutines easily. Goroutine and channels are usually combinated to complete our concurrenct task. This concept is extremely important and  can be hard to understand. Reading is easy, only practice works, so write more.
