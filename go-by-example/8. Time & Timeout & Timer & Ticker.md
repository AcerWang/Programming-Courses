# Time & Timeout & Timer & Ticker

## 1. Introduction

Usually, in our programs, we need to deal with datetime. The golang has a convenient built-in *time* package for us to use, it provides us many methods to operate the *time* struct. The *timeout*, *timers* and *tickers* are commonly used to timed tasks with channels and goroutines. This experiment will give you a tour to them.

#### Learning Objective

- time parse & format
- timeout
- timer
- ticker

### 2.1 Time

Go offers extensive support for time and duration. To use `time` , firstly `import time` to include the standard time package. Here are some examples. We'll start by getting the current time. You can build a `time` struct by providing the year, month, day, etc. Times are always associated with a `Location`, i.e. time zone. You can extract the various components of the time value as expected. The `Sub` methods returns a `Duration` representing the interval between two time. We can compute the length of the duration in various units. You can use `Add` to advance a time by a given duration, or with a `-` to move backwards by a duration. Write the following code in `time.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "time"

func main() {
    
    p := fmt.Println
    
    // get the current time
    now := time.Now()
    p(now)
    
    // specify a time in this way
    then := time.Date(
        2009, 11, 17, 20, 34, 58, 651387237, time.UTC)
    p(then)
    
    // you can output each field of the time struct separately
    p(then.Year())
    p(then.Month())
    p(then.Day())
    p(then.Hour())
    p(then.Minute())
    p(then.Second())
    p(then.Nanosecond())
    p(then.Location())
    
    // user the method to get weekday of today
    p(then.Weekday())
    
    // compare two time
    p(then.Before(now))
    p(then.After(now))
    p(then.Equal(now))
    
    // get the `Duration` between two time
    diff := now.Sub(then)
    p(diff)
    
    // output `Duration` in different format
    p(diff.Hours())
    p(diff.Minutes())
    p(diff.Seconds())
    p(diff.Nanoseconds())
    
    // establish a new time with the `Duration`
    p(then.Add(diff))
    p(then.Add(-diff))
}
```

**Output:**

```

```

Go supports time formatting and parsing via pattern-based layouts. Here's a basic example of formatting a time according to RFC3339, using the corresponding layout constant. Write the following code in `time-parsing.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "time"

func main() {
    
    p := fmt.Println
    
    t := time.Now()
    // use RFC3339 to format a time
    p(t.Format(time.RFC3339))
    
    // parse a string to time with format RFC3339
    t1, e := time.Parse(
        time.RFC3339,
        "2012-11-01T22:08:41+00:00")
    p(t1)
    
    // format time with the given layout
    p(t.Format("3:04PM"))
    p(t.Format("Mon Jan _2 15:04:05 2006"))
    p(t.Format("2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999-07:00"))
    
    form := "3 04 PM"
    // parse a string to time with given form
    t2, e := time.Parse(form, "8 41 PM")
    p(t2)
    
    // formatted output time
    fmt.Printf("%d-%02d-%02dT%02d:%02d:%02d-00:00\n",
        t.Year(), t.Month(), t.Day(),
        t.Hour(), t.Minute(), t.Second())
    
    // parse a string to time with the given form
    // print the error message
    ansic := "Mon Jan _2 15:04:05 2006"
    _, e = time.Parse(ansic, "8:41PM")
    p(e)
}
```

`Format` and `Parse` use example-based layouts. Usually you'll use a constant from `time` for these layouts, but you can also supply custom layouts. Layouts must use the reference time `Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006` to show the pattern with which to format/parse a given time/string. The example time must be exactly as shown: the year 2006, 15 for the hour, Monday for the day of the week, etc. For purely numeric representations you can also use standard string formatting with the extracted components of the time value. `Parse` will return an error on malformed input explaining the parsing problem.

**Output:**

```
$ go run time-parsing.go 
2018-06-12T15:36:02+08:00

### 2.2 Timeout

*Timeout* is important for programs that connect to external resources or that otherwise need to bound execution time. Implementing timeout in Go is easy and elegant thanks to *channels* and `select`. For our example, suppose we're executing an external call that returns its result on a channel `c1` after 2s. Here's the `select` implementing a timeout. `res := <-c1`awaits the result and `<-Time.After` awaits a value to be sent after the timeout of 1s. Since `select` proceeds with the first receive that's ready, we'll take the timeout case if the operation takes more than the allowed 1s. If we allow a longer timeout of 3s, then the receive from `c2`will succeed and we'll print the result. Running this program shows the first operation timing out and the second succeeding. Using this `select` timeout pattern requires communicating results over channels. Write the following code in `timeout.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "time"
import "fmt"

func main() {

	// make a buffered channel
	c1 := make(chan string, 1)
	// in a new goroutine, wait for 2 seconds 
	// and send a message to the channel
    go func() {
        time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
        c1 <- "result 1"
    }()
    
    fmt.Println("wait 1 second...")
    // first as channel `c1`,`time.After` is not ready, 
    // so blocked here waiting for them to get ready, 
    // after 1 second, the second case is ready and select it
    select {
        case res := <-c1:
            fmt.Println(res)
        case <-time.After(1 * time.Second):
            fmt.Println("timeout 1")
    }
    
    // make another buffered channel
    c2 := make(chan string, 1)
    // in a new goroutine, wait for 2 seconds 
	// and send a message to the channel
    go func() {
        time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
        c2 <- "result 2"
    }()
    
    fmt.Println("wait 2 seconds...")
    // first as channel `c2`,`time.After` is not ready, 
    // so blocked here waiting for them to get ready, 
    // after 2 second, the first case is ready and select it
    select {
        case res := <-c2:
            fmt.Println(res)
        case <-time.After(3 * time.Second):
            fmt.Println("timeout 2")
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
$ go run timeout.go 
wait 1 second...
timeout 1
wait 2 seconds...
result 2
```

This is a good idea in general, because other important Go features are based on channels and `select`. We'll look at two examples of this next: timers and tickers.

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/Code/timeout.go
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "timeout.go" in /home/labex/Code!
  timeout: 3
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'time.after' /home/labex/Code/timeout.go
  error: Oops, we find that you didn't use "time.After()" method in "timeout.go".
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.3 Timer

We often want to execute Go code at some point in the future, or repeatedly at some interval. Go's built-in *timer* and *ticker* features make both of these tasks easy. Timers represent a single event in the future. You tell the timer how long you want to wait, and it provides a channel that will be notified at that time. This timer will wait 2 seconds. Write the following code in `timer.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "time"
import "fmt"

func main() {

	// create a new timer of 2 seconds
	timer1 := time.NewTimer(2 * time.Second)
	
	fmt.Println("wait 2 seconds...")
	// the channel `timer1.C` will get ready after 2 seconds
	// so it will blocks here waiting for 2 seconds
	<-timer1.C
	fmt.Println("Timer 1 expired")

	// create another timer of 1 second
	timer2 := time.NewTimer(time.Second)
	// in a new goroutine, wait for the `timer2.C` channel to get ready
	go func() {
		<-timer2.C
		fmt.Println("Timer 2 expired")
	}()
	// we stop the `timer2` immediately,and terminate the `timer2` goroutine
	stop2 := timer2.Stop()
	if stop2 {
		fmt.Println("Timer 2 stopped")
	}
}
```

The `<-timer1.C` blocks on the timer's channel `C` until it sends a value indicating that the timer expired. If you just wanted to wait, you could have used `time.Sleep`. One reason a timer may be useful is that you can cancel the timer before it expires. As the example shows. The first timer will expire ~2s after we start the program, but the second should be stopped before it has a chance to expire.

**Output:**

```
$ go run timer.go
wait 2 seconds...
Timer 1 expired
Timer 2 stopped
```

  script: |
    #!/bin/bash

  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "timer.go" in /home/labex/Code!
  timeout: 3
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'time.newtimer' /home/labex/Code/timer.go
  error: Oops, we find that you didn't use "time.NewTimer()" method in "timer.go".
  timeout: 3
```

### 2.4 Ticker

*Timers* are for when you want to do something once in the future - *tickers* are for when you want to do something repeatedly at regular intervals. Tickers use a similar mechanism to timers: a channel that is sent values. Here we'll use the built-in `range` on the channel to iterate over the values as they arrive every 1000ms. Tickers can be stopped like timers. Once a ticker is stopped it won't receive any more values on its channel. We'll stop ours after 3800ms. Here's an example of a ticker that ticks periodically until we stop it. Write the following code in `ticker.go` in `/home/labex/Code`.

```go
package main

import "time"
import "fmt"

func main() {

	// create a new ticker of 1000ms
	ticker := time.NewTicker(1000 * time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Println("start ticking...")
	// in a new goroutine, range over the `ticker` value
	go func() {
		for t := range ticker.C {
			fmt.Println("Tick at", t)
		}
	}()

	// wait for 3800ms in the main goroutine
	time.Sleep(3800 * time.Millisecond)
	// then stop the ticker and terminate `ticker` goroutine
	ticker.Stop()
	fmt.Println("Ticker stopped")
}
```

When we run this program the ticker should tick 3 times before we stop it. Be careful about the ticker and use the `Stop` to explicitly end it if no need to use it, otherwise it may cause goroutine leaks.

**Output:**

```
$ go run ticker.go
start ticking...
Tick at 2018-06-12 15:43:06.189669695 +0800 CST
Tick at 2018-06-12 15:43:07.189755966 +0800 CST
Tick at 2018-06-12 15:43:08.18968671 +0800 CST
Ticker stopped
```

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/Code/ticker.go
  error: Sorry, you didn't create file "ticker.go" in /home/labex/Code!
  timeout: 3
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'time.newticker' /home/labex/Code/ticker.go
  error: Oops, we find that you didn't use "time.NewTicker()" method in "ticker.go".
  timeout: 3
```

## 3. Summary

Now, you have already known how to deal with datetime and how to design a timer and ticker. To make use of them, you must have good understanding with the goroutines and channels. Only combinating them with Go's concurrency will reveal their  great power.
