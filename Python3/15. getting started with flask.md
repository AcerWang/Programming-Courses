# Getting Started with Flask

## Introduction

Flask is a famous framework in the Python community. Flask is designed to expand through the plug-in.Flask itself only maintain a core. If you want to compare with Django, then Django is more like the computer machine from a big brand, and you do not have to worry about what accessories to use, because Django have all you need. And Flask can be said to be a assembly machine, and more accurately it is a well-designed CPU. This gives you great flexibility to choose the required accessories (plugins).

### Knowledge Point

- Introduction to Flask
- Configuration method
- Register the route
- Template rendering
- Request object
- Session
- Cookies
- Error handling
- Plugin

## An Easy Example

In the environment, we have already installed the flask and some other required packages for use, so you just need to import them. If you find some packages missing, just use `pip3 install packagename`. 

One of the simplest examples,  first create a folder called 'test' on your Desktop, and create `app.py` in the folder, and write:

```py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

Flask provides a command line tool for managing Flask applications. First, set variables of the application environment:

```py
export FLASK_APP=app.py
```

Then you can run Flask like this:

```py
flask run
```

Another way to run this program: open the terminal, do as follows:

By default, the application runs on `localhost:5000`. Open the browser, and visit this address will be able to see the return of the `Hello World!`

## Configuration

After initializing a Flask app, you can manage the configuration via `app.config`. `app.config` is essentially a dictionary, so you can add or update the configuration in a dictionary way. For example, after initializing the app, you configure a key:

```py
app = Flask_=(__name__)
app.config.update({
	  'SECRET_KEY': 'a random string' 
})
```

All configuration options need to be in uppercase, and multiple words are linked with '_'. In large projects, the configuration is usually written in a separate `config.py` file, this time you can use` app.config` to provide a unique way to update the `config`:

```py
app.config.from_pyfile('path/to/config.py')
```

Other similar methods:

- `from_envvar (variable_name)`: update configuration using the configuration file specified by an environment variable
- `from_object (obj)`: use an object to update the configuration file, and dict is invalid
- `from_json (filename)`: use the JSON file to update the configuration
- `from_mapping (* mapping, ** kwargs)`: similar to the use of `update`, the difference is that this method does not force the use of capital letters



## Register the Route

Flask uses the `app.route` decorator to register routes and their handling functions. In the example above, to use the home page `/` to register a route, and the `index` function will be used to deal with Flask in visiting home page .

You can pass variables in the route in the form of ` variable_name> `, for example, each user's home page needs a different route, so you can use the user name as a variable for the route:

```py
@app.route('/user/<username>')
def user_index(username):
    # Name the variable name in the function so that you can get the value of the variable passed in by route
    return 'Hello {}'.format(username)
```

You can also specify the type of routing variables, for example, a blog application of each blog page can use this blog ID as a routing variable, ID should be a `int` type of value:

```py
@app.route('/post/<int:post_id>')
def show_post(post_id):
    return 'Post {}'.format(post_id)
```

Write the two methods in app.py, you can test these router by accessing the url ( localhost:5000/user/labex , localhost:5000/post/1 )

## Template Rendering

In the example above, the handler returns a string, but in a real project, you need to write the page using HTML, and it is not possible to write all the content to the string. The role of the template engine is that you use the template engine to specify the syntax of the preparation of HTML pages; specify template in the function processing, and pass in the corresponding template variables, then Flask will be able to call the template engine to automatically render a complete HTML page.

Flask default template engine is jinja2. Theoretically you can replace the other template engine, but jinja2 is already easy to use.

Flask uses the render_template's function to render the template and specify a template name. Flask goes to the `templates` directory to find the template and then renders the template using the passed variable.

If we use the template to rewrite the user's home page, then the handler can be written like this:

```py
from flask import render_template

@app.route('/user/<username>')
def user_index(username):
    return render_template('user_index.html', username=username)
```

And then create the `templates` directory, the directory structure is like this:

```
/flask-test-app
    app.py
    /templates
        user_index.html
```

in `user_index.html` :

```html
<h1>Hello, {{ username }}!</h1>
```

In jinja2, use `{{}}` to render a string variable. Now visit a user home page, like:

```
localhost:5000/user/labex
```

You can see a  `Hello, labex!` wrapped with the h1.

## Request Object

Flask gets the request-related data through the `request` object. To use it, you have to import from the flask:

```py
from flask import request
```

Data requested from `request.headers` data can be used as a dictionary, such as acquiring the user's `user-agent`:

```py
request.headers.get('User-Agent')
```

From the request request to obtain the requested parameters, assuming that our application is a blog application, the home page has a paging function, use this URL to visit the home page:

```py
localhost:5000?page=2&per_page=10
```

You can get the parameters after `?` by doing this:

```py
page = request.args.get('page')
per_page = request.args.get('per_page')
```

In addition to processing, you can get data  via `request.form` and get the current request via` request.method` '.

## session

The HTTP protocol is stateless, and each time when we request, their relationship remains independent of each other. But in the practical application, we do have a lot of data server that are not suitable for storage in the database while need to be remembered.
For example, a login page requires the verification code when a user password input has an error 3 times.The server will need a counter to record the frequency of errors, but to put it into the database is not appropriate. `session` is used to store some data for each user. The data stored in the `session` can be shared between multiple requests for a particular user.

## cookies

`cookies` is similar to `session`, but `cookies` lies in client-side encryption information. In Flask, `cookie` uses the configured ` SECRET_KEY` as the signature for encryption.

For example, in the route visiting the users' home page, to set the user's name as `cookies`, and we will know the person when he is accessing.

```py
from flask import make_response

@app.route('/user/<username>')
def user_index(username):
    resp = make_response(render_template('user_index.html', username=username))
	resp.set_cookie('username', username)
    return resp
```

After you set `cookies`, users can visit other pages via `request.cookies` to acquire the `username` we set.

```py
from flask import request

@app.route('/')
def index():
    username = request.cookies.get('username')
	return 'Hello {}'.format(username)
```

You first access localhost:5000/user/labex, and then access localhost:5000, you'll see the correct output as follows.

## Error Handling

Use the `app.errorhandler` decorator to register error handling functions, such as the most common one 404 error, and we return a specific` 404.html` page.

```py
@app.errorhandler(404)
def not_found(error):
    return render_template('404.html'), 404
```

The example also shows a little point when using `render_template`, that is, it can be specified in the back of the status code.

## Plugin 

Here are some of the plugins commonly used in Flask development. They will mostly be used in later projects, and because of the space we can not introduce in detail. Each plugin can be found in Github, you can search and have a look.

- flask_sqlalchemy: ORM, encapsulates sqlalchemy, and it is easier to use
- flask-login: manage user session, such as login, logout, session expired management, and so on
- flask_migrate: database version management
- flask_wtf: encapsulates the wtforms form generation and validation tool, which provides CSRF support
- flask-session: flask default session based on the client cookie, the plugin facilitate us to do the session on the server 

## Conclusion

This section examines the basics of Flask Web application development with some simple development examples. The content includes the following points:

1. Introduction to Flask
2. Configuration method
3. Register the route
4. Template rendering
5. Request object
6. session
7. Cookies
8. Error handling
9. Plugin

In the actual project development, Flask will use a large number of plugins, such as docking with the database using the `flask_sqlalchemy`; the management of login and out of the session uses `flask-login`. The use of these plug-ins can greatly improve our efficiency on Web applications development, so when you have any development needs, first to search whether there is a ready-made module available, if there is one, you can use it according to the referrence document.
