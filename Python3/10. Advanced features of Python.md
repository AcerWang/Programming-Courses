# Advanced Features of Python

## 1. Introduction

Python language has a lot of advanced usages, and these usages are relatively difficult to understand, but being familiar with the program can greatly improve the efficiency and quality of the code. We have chosen one of the most commonly used features in this lab to learn.

### Learning Objective

- Lambda anonymous function
- Slice
- List analysis
- Dictionary analysis
- Iterator
- Builder
- Yield
- Decorator

## 2. Content

###2.1 lambda

Python provides the support for anonymous functions via `lambda`, and the use of the method is very simple. See the following example:

```py
>>> double = lambda x: x * 2
>>> double(5)
10
```

In the above example, the variable is actually an anonymous function. When used, the `double (x)` will directly execute the content of function, but this example is not the most common use of `lambda`.

In the example, an anonymous function is defined by using `lambda`. Returning values of `lambda` does not require ` return`. `lambda` function is usually used to pass  a function as a parameter, and this function is only used in this one case. The anonymous function is generally passed as a parameter.

###2.2 Slice

The slice is used to get a sequence (list or tuple) or a portion of a string that returns a new sequence or string, using brackets to specify a start and end subscripts of a list. Separated by colons, slice is explained in the previous lab that it is not merely a string. It is also very common that list or tuple use slices.

Take list as an example:

```py
>>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
>>> letters[1:3]
['b', 'c']
```


![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/Y/L/F/ezgsPgdoERNs.png)


The subscript can be either positive or negative. Correspondence of the letter subscript:

```
 0  1  2  3  4  5  6
 a  b  c  d  e  f  g
-7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1
```

so you can write like this:

```py
>>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
>>> letters[1:-4]
['b', 'c']
```

If you omit start, then the default value for start will be 0, while omitting end means to cut to the last:

```py
>>> letters[:4]
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
>>> letters[4:]
['e', 'f', 'g']
```

You can use the feature of the slice to return a new list to copy a list:

```py
>>> copy = letters[:]
>>> copy
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
```

###2.3 list comprehension

List comprehension is also regarded as list derivation. It is a new feature in Python 2.0, providing a kind of simple and elegant way to operate elements. Look at this example:

```py
>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# Get all even numbers in numbers
>>> [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
# Square for each number of numbers
>>> [x * x for x in numbers]
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 47, 84, 81, 100]
```

Python provides some high-level functions such as `map`, ` filter`, and anonymous function `lambda`. The high order function means a function that can pass functions as arguments and manipulate the data using the passed function.

We can also use high-order function to complete the above example of the operation,:

```py
>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
>>> f = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)
>>> for i in f:
...    print(i)
2
4
6
8
10
>>> m = map(lambda x: x * x, numbers)
>>> for i in m:
...    print(i)
...
1
4
9
16
25
36
49
64
81
100
>>>
```

Compare these two kinds of realization, we personally feel that the use of list analysis is more simple and easy to read. In addition, because the use of high-order function increases the cost of calling the function,  its space-time efficiency is not as good as the use of list analysis. It is no wonder even the Python authors also recommend the use of the list of analysis.

###2.4 dict comprehension

Having Understood the list of analysis, dictionary analysis is very easy. It is to change the list to the dictionary, and the object is the key and value in the dictionary.Here is an example:

```py
>>> d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
>>> {k:v*v for k, v in d.items()}
{'a': 1, 'b': 4, 'c': 9}
```

It should be noted that the dictionary can not be iterated, and you need to use the dictionary method `items ()` to turn dictionary into an iterative object.

###2.5 Iterator

If you have learnt the iterator pattern in the design pattern, you can easily understand the concept. To understand the iterator, first we need to understand the difference between the iterator and the iterable object. The one to read the operation object one by one is called iteration. In Python, the iterable object is the element that you can iterize it with `for ... in`.For example, the list is iterable:

```py
>>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> for letter in letters:
...     print(letter)
...
a
b
c
>>>
```


![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/A/X/N/TpN4tMtGz8Dn.png)


The iterator means that you can use the `next` function to get its next value until the iterator returns the` StopIteration` exception. All iterable objects can get its iterator through the `iter` function, such as `letters` above is an iterable object, and you can iterate like this:

```py
>>> it = iter(letters)
>>> next(it)
'a'
>>> next(it)
'b'
>>> next(it)
'c'
>>> next(it)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
StopIteration
```


![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/M/M/N/HaVvI4wBIWEO.png)


All the iterable object basically implement the `__iter__` and` __next__` these two magic method, and in fact, iter() and the next() function is actually called the magic methods.The example above is actually like this:

```py
>>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> it = letters.__iter__()
>>> it.__next__()
'a'
>>> it.__next__()
'b'
>>> it.__next__()
'c'
>>> it.__next__()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
StopIteration
```

to summarize:

Those can be accessed to loop through by 'for' are iterable objects, and be acquired by the next () function to obtain the next value is the iterator.

###2.6 Generator

We have introduced the concept of iterable objects and iterators. The generator first is an iterator, the difference is, **generator can only be iterated once **, because each iteration of the elements is not the same as the list elements that are already in memory, but rather you iterate once, it generates an element.

Create a generator and iterate over it:

```py
>>> g = (x**x for x in range(1, 4))
>>> g
<generator object <genexpr> at 0x10d1a5af0>
>>> for x in g:
...     print(x)
...
1
4
27
```

It is a bit like list, but it uses parentheses. Different from the list that can be iterated again, even you iterates the iterator, it will neither print elements nor return the wrong.

What are the benefits of using a generator? Because the generator does not put all the elements in memory but dynamically generated, so when you want to iterate the object with a lot of elements, using the generator can save you a lot of memory, which is a memory-friendly feature.

###2.7 yield

The use of ` yield` is similar to `return`. The difference is that `return` returns a valid Python object, while ` yield` returns a generator. The function returns a object when running to  `return`. If the function contains `yield`,  this function will return a element when it runs to `yield`. And when iterates the iterator again, it will continue from `yield` until it encounters the next` yield` or the function ends.

Here is the iterations of the first n elements of a Fibon list :

```py
>>> def fib(n):
...     current = 0
...     a, b = 1, 1
...     while current < n:
...         yield a
...         a, b = b, a + b
...         current += 1
...
```

The above function uses `yield` to return a generator. If we want to iterate over the first five elements of the Fibonacci sequence, the function that calls the function returns is a generator:

```py
>>> f5 = fib(5)
>>> f5
<generator object fib at 0x10d1a5888>
```

Iteration:

```py
>>> for x in f5:
...     print(x)
...
1
1
2
3
5
```

###2.8 Decorator

The decorator can add additional functionality to the function without affecting the main function. In Python, a function is a first-class citizen, that is, a function can be passed as a parameter to another function, and a function can use another function as the return value, which is the basis for the decorator implementation. The decorator is a function essentially that accepts a function as a parameter. Let's have a look at this simple example, which is also the classic use of the decorator scene, to record the function call `log`:

```py
>>> from datetime import datetime
>>> def log(func):
...     def decorator(*args, **kwargs):
...         print('Function ' + func.__name__ + ' has been called at ' + datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'))
...         return func(*args, **kwargs)
...     return decorator
...
>>> @log
... def add(x, y):
...     return x + y
...
>>> add(1, 2)
Function add has been called at 2018-02-09 15:05:09
3
```


![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/R/E/F/vraH8KKAQ1cL.png)


@* is the syntactic sugar provided by Python, which is equivalent to doing the following operation:

```py
>>> def add(x, y):
...     return x + y
...
>>> add = log(add)
>>> add(1, 2)
Function add has been called at 2017-08-29 13:16:02
3
```
that is to say,calling `log` to pass in the` add` function which is a parameter. The `log` function returns a separate function` decorator`. In this function, the log information is printed first, and then call back the incoming `func`, that is, ` add `function.

You may have found that after executing `add = log (add)`, or decorating 'add' with '@log' , the 'add' is no longer the original one. Believe it or not, it has become the `decorator` function returned by the` log` function:

```py
>>> add.__name__
'decorator'
```

This is also the side effect of the decorator, and Python provides a way to solve this problem:

```py
>>> from functools import wraps
>>> def log(func):
...     @wraps(func)
...     def decorator(*args, **kwargs):
...         print('Function ' + func.__name__ + ' has been called at ' + datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'))
...         return func(*args, **kwargs)
...     return decorator
...
>>> @log
... def add(x, y):
...     return x + y
...
>>> add.__name__
'add'
```

##3. Summary


This section of the experiment is to learn some of the commonly used advanced usages of Python programming language. These advanced usages need putting in the actual development of the project in order to be fully grasped. It is hard to understand simply from the literal meaning.
