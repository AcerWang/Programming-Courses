# Experiment 1: Game Design

## 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Content
In this lab, we will analyze the train of thoughts before we design the Tetris, and we will introduce the way to use the ncurses library.

#### 1.2 Learning Objective
+ basics of C++
+ ncurses library
+ Logistic design of the Tetris

#### 1.3 Environment Requirement 

+ xfce terminal
+ g++ compiler
+ ncurses library

#### 1.4 Target users
This course is of medium difficulty, so it suits for the peopole who has basic C++ programing skills and the interest in both game design and logistic analyzing.

#### 1.5 Source Code
```sh
wget https://labexfile.oss-us-west-1-internal.aliyuncs.com/courses/94/game_zero.zip
```

## 2.Preprations

#### 2.1 Install Ncurses Library
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
```

#### 2.2 Compile
Please add option "-l" into ncurses library to compile your commands.
```sh
g++ main.cpp -l ncurses
```

## 3. Theory

- Analysis
- Image prepare
- Use ncurses library

### 3.1 Analysis

Before working on the program, we should figure out what functions to implement, and what modules to divide. Next, about the Tetris, the first thing coming into our mind should be displaying the cubes, and the followings are how the cubes fall, move horizontally and rotate. And at last, the layer full of cubes should be removed. Additionally, a basic Tetris should have a prompt function to show the shape of the next cube.

So the problems to be solved while programming are:

+ *Display the cubes*
+ *Implement the movement of the cubes*
+ *Rotate the cube*
+ *Remove the layer full of cubes*
+ *Prompt the shape of the next cube*

### 3.2 Basic Images

Every cube is made of 4 boxes, and it falls from the center of the window. It can rotate while not touching the border and other cubes.

### 3.3 How to Use NCURSES Library

Basicly, NCURSES is a clone of CURSES in System V Release 4.0 (SVr4). It's a library that can be configured freely, and it's compeletly compatible with the old version of CURSES. Besides, you can use applications to directly control the terminal window display in this library. NCURSES packages the terminal function of the infrastructure, including some functions that create windows. It is the extention of Menu, Panel, Form in the CURSES basic library. We can build an application that contains multiple windows, menus, panels and forms in the same time. Windows can be managed independently, like making it scroll or hide. Menus can let users build command options to make it easier to execute the command. And forms allow users to build some simple windows to input data and display it. Panels are the extention of the windows management function in NCURSES, you can use Panels to cover or accmulate the windows.

#### 3.3.1 Begin with  "Hello World"

If you invoke functions in NCURSES library, you must load the ncurses.h file in the code. (stdio.h is already contained in ncurses.h)

Example:
```c++
#include <ncurses.h>

int main()
{
	initscr();   //Initialize, enter NCURSES mode
	printw("Hello World!"); //Print Hello World in the virtual screen
	refresh(); //Write the content of the virtual screen on the display and refresh
	getch();  //Wait for the user to input
	endwin(); //Exit NCURSES mode
	return 0;
}
```


In the example above, we have introduced the way to use the most basic functions in NCURSES library. What the FUNCTIONS can do is already written in the comment, so we won't repeat.

#### 3.3.2 The Mechanism of Window

As NCURSES initializes, it will create a window named stdscr by default. The size of the window is usually 80 rows and 25 columns(the size defers from the  monitor or video card). Besides, you can also create your own window by using the functions in the window system.

For example, if you invoke the following function:
```c++
printw("Hi!");
refresh();
```

It would input "Hi" in the current cursor position on stdscr, invoke the **`refresh()`** function and only update the buffer area on stdscr.

If you have already built a window named win and want to output content in the win window, you can add M before the normal functions while the parameter is also changing.
```c++
printw(string); //Print String string in the current cursor position on stdscr
                 
mvprintw(y,x,string);  //Print String string in the coordinate (y,x)
wprintw(win,string); //Print String string in the current cursor position in win window
mvwprintw(win,y,x,string);  //Move the cursor to the coordinate (y,x) in win window and print string
```

**I believe that after reading the example above, you can already tell the functional differences in the functions by the way we name the functions.**

#### 3.3.3 `Newwin() and Box()`:

Building a window begins with **`newin().` **The function will return a pointer to the the structure of the window. this pointer can be transferred to functions that need window parameter like **`wprintw()`**
However, we've built a window that can't be seen, we need to use **`box()`** function to draw a border in the identified windows.

For example
```c++
WINDOW *create_newwin(int height, int width, int starty, int startx)
{
	WINDOW *local_win;
	local_win = newin(height, width, starty, startx);
	box(local_win, 0, 0);
	wrefresh(local_win);
	return local_win;
}
```

We've finished the introduction to the basic ways to use NCURSES library. You still need to refer to the related files while running into problems in your work.
