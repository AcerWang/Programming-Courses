# Implement Memory Pool

## 1. Introduction

The memory allocated to the memory pool is faster than the memory allocated to it from the heap. A long-term, stable-running memory allocation service is necessary in many situations. Similar to the default allocator in the standard library, the memory pool is essentially a distributor. This project will design and use C++ to implement a high-performance memory pool.

#### Things to Learn

- C++ allocator `std::allocator`
- Memory pool technology
- Manually implement chain stack template
- chain stack and list stack performance comparison

#### Final Results

## 2. Designing Memory Pool

In the previous experiment, we used the default constructor in the template linked list stack to manage the element memory in the stack operation. It involved `rebind<T>::other`, `allocate()`, `dealocate()`, `construct()` and `destroy()` interfaces. So in order to make the code directly usable, we should also design the same interface in the memory pool:

```cpp
#ifndef MEMORY_POOL_HPP
#define MEMORY_POOL_HPP

#include <climits>
#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>
template <typename T, size_t BlockSize = 4096>
class MemoryPool
{
  public:
    // use typedef simplify writing
    typedef T* pointer;

    // define interface: rebind<U>::other
    template <typename U> struct rebind {
      typedef MemoryPool<U> other;
    };

    // default constructor
    MemoryPool() noexcept {
      currentBlock_ = nullptr;
      currentSlot_ = nullptr;
      lastSlot_ = nullptr;
      freeSlots_ = nullptr;
    }

    // destroy memory pool
    ~MemoryPool() noexcept;

    // can only allocate one object in a moment, n and hint will be ignored
    pointer allocate(size_t n = 1, const T* hint = 0);

    // destroy memory block pointed by pointer p
    void deallocate(pointer p, size_t n = 1);

    // call constructor, use std::forward for passing parameters
    template <typename U, typename... Args>
    void construct(U* p, Args&&... args);

    // destroy all objects, call deconstructor
    template <typename U>
    void destroy(U* p) {
      p->~U();
    }

  private:
    // Use for store all objects in memory pool
    union Slot_ {
      T element;
      Slot_* next;
    };

    typedef char* data_pointer_;
    typedef Slot_ slot_type_;
    typedef Slot_* slot_pointer_;

    slot_pointer_ currentBlock_;
    slot_pointer_ currentSlot_;
    slot_pointer_ lastSlot_;
    slot_pointer_ freeSlots_;
    static_assert(BlockSize >= 2 * sizeof(slot_type_), "BlockSize too small.");
};

#endif // MEMORY_POOL_HPP
```

In the above design, as you can see that in this memory pool, we actually use the linked list to manage the entire memory pool's memory block. The memory pool first defines a fixed-size basic memory block (Block), and then defines therein a union of an object slot (Slot_) and an object slot pointer that can be instantiated as a memory slot for the object. Then in the block, four key pointers are defined. Their roles are:

1. `currentBlock_`: Pointer to the current memory block
2. `currentSlot_`: points to the object slot in the current memory block
3. `lastSlot_`: points to the last object slot in the current memory block
4. `freeSlots_`: points to all free slots in the current memory block

After combing the design structure of the entire memory pool, we can begin to implement the key logic.

```checker
- name: check if file exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    ls /home/labex/Code/MemoryPool.hpp
    error: Sorry, you didn't create file "MemoryPool.hpp" in /home/labex/Code/!
  timeout: 3
```

### 3.1 MemoryPool::construct()

The logic of `MemoryPool::construct()` is the simplest, we need to implement, just call the constructor of the letter object, so:

```cpp
// call constructor, use std::forward for passing parameters
template <typename U, typename... Args>
void construct(U* p, Args&&... args) {
    new (p) U (std::forward<Args>(args)...);
}
```
```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'void\s+construct' /home/labex/Code/MemoryPool.hpp
    error: Oops, we find that you didn't create method "construct()" in "MemoryPool.hpp".
  timeout: 3
```
### 3.2 MemoryPool::deallocate()

`MemoryPool::deallocate()` is called after the object in the object slot has been destroyed. The main purpose is to destroy the memory slot. Its logic is also not complicated:

```cpp
// destroy memory block pointed by pointer p
void deallocate(pointer p, size_t n = 1) {
    if (p != nullptr) {
    reinterpret_cast<slot_pointer_>(p)->next = freeSlots_;
    freeSlots_ = reinterpret_cast<slot_pointer_>(p);
    }
}
```
```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'void\s+deallocate' /home/labex/Code/MemoryPool.hpp
    error: Oops, we find that you didn't create method "deallocate()" in "MemoryPool.hpp".
  timeout: 3
```
### 3.3 MemoryPool::~MemoryPool()

The destructor is responsible for destroying the entire memory pool, so we need to delete the memory blocks originally applied to the operating system one by one:

```cpp
// destroy memory pool
~MemoryPool() noexcept {
    // destroy all memory block
    slot_pointer_ curr = currentBlock_;
    while (curr != nullptr) {
    slot_pointer_ prev = curr->next;
    operator delete(reinterpret_cast<void*>(curr));
    curr = prev;
    }
}
```
```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i '~memorypool' /home/labex/Code/MemoryPool.hpp
    error: Oops, we find that you didn't create method "~MemoryPool()" in "MemoryPool.hpp".
  timeout: 3
```
### 3.4 MemoryPool::allocate()

`MemoryPool::allocate()` is undoubtedly the key to the entire memory pool, but after the design of the entire memory pool is actually clarified. A specific implementation is as follows:

```cpp
// can only allocate one object in a moment, n and hint will be ignored
pointer allocate(size_t n = 1, const T* hint = 0) {
    // if there is an empty slot, handover the free slot
    if (freeSlots_ != nullptr) {
    pointer result = reinterpret_cast<pointer>(freeSlots_);
    freeSlots_ = freeSlots_->next;
    return result;
    } else {
    // if object slot has run out, allocate a new memory block
    if (currentSlot_ >= lastSlot_) {
        // allocate a new memory block, point to privous memory block
        data_pointer_ newBlock = reinterpret_cast<data_pointer_>(operator new(BlockSize));
        reinterpret_cast<slot_pointer_>(newBlock)->next = currentBlock_;
        currentBlock_ = reinterpret_cast<slot_pointer_>(newBlock);
        // fill the entire block to satisfy the entire memory block alignment
        data_pointer_ body = newBlock + sizeof(slot_pointer_);
        uintptr_t result = reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(body);
        std::cout << (alignof(slot_type_) - result) % alignof(slot_type_) << std::endl;
        size_t bodyPadding = (alignof(slot_type_) - result) % alignof(slot_type_);
        std::cout << bodyPadding << std::endl; 
        currentSlot_ = reinterpret_cast<slot_pointer_>(body + bodyPadding);
        lastSlot_ = reinterpret_cast<slot_pointer_>(newBlock + BlockSize - sizeof(slot_type_) + 1);
    }
    return reinterpret_cast<pointer>(currentSlot_++);
    }
}
```
Here is a graph that helps you to understand the implementation:

```checker
- name: check if keyword exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -iE 'pointer\s+allocate' /home/labex/Code/MemoryPool.hpp
    error: Oops, we find that you didn't create method "allocate()" in "MemoryPool.hpp".
  timeout: 3
```

## 4. Performance Comparison with std::vector

We know that for the stack, it is not the best way to use stack for implementation, because the stack of this structure will inevitably involve pointer-related operations, but also consume a certain amount of space to store the node pointers. In fact, we can use the `push_back()` and `pop_back()` operations in `std::vector` to simulate a stack. Let's compare this `std::vector` with what we have implemented. The memory pool is high and low in performance. We add the following code in the main function:

```cpp
// compare performance between memory pool and std::vector
std::vector<int> stackVector;
start = clock();
for (int j = 0; j < REPS; j++) {
    assert(stackVector.empty());
    for (int i = 0; i < ELEMS; i++)
        stackVector.push_back(i);
    for (int i = 0; i < ELEMS; i++)
        stackVector.pop_back();
}
std::cout << "Vector Time: ";
std::cout << (((double)clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC) << "\n\n";
```

## 5. Summary

Now, we can compiler our code and check the performance gap between three different implementation:

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/K/G/B/5aHKySIg09Q6.png)

The first is to use the default allocator with the slowest linked-list stack, and we use `std::vector` simulate stack structure, which significantly reduces the time on the basis of the linked-list stack.

> The implementation of `std::vector` is similar to the memory pool. When the `std::vector` memory space is not enough, it will abandon the current memory area and reapply for a larger area, and copy the data into a new memory area.

Finally, we implemented the high performance memory pool.
