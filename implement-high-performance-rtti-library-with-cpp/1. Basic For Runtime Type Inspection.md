# Basic For Runtime Type Inspection

## 1. Introduction

RTTI is an abbreviation for runtime type information.
C++ provides runtime type inspection operators `dynamic_cast` and `typeid`.
However, the `dynamic_cast` is not efficiency and requires sacrificing of performance. This project guides you implement a high performance RTTI library.

#### Things to Learn

- Runtime type inspection: `dynamic_cast`, `typeid`
- Explicit type conversion: `static_cast`, `const_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`

#### Final Results

The following image shows the final implementation of our RTTI library, and the performance eventually is twice of the performance of native `dynamic_cast`.

## 2. Runtime Type Inspection

C++ provides virtual functions, which led to the existence of polymorphism.
For a polymorphic object, during the compile time, a compiler may not be able to determine the type of a polymorphic object.
When the class contains a virtual function, the base class pointer can points to any derived class object, which led to the inability of knowing which class is exactly pointed by the base class pointer.
Therefore, RTTI was born for runtime type identification of a class.

RTTI, an abbreviation of Run Time Type Information, through the run-time type information, program can use the base class pointer or reference to check these pointers or referenced objects. RTTI provides two operators, namely:

- `typeid`: return the actual type referred to by the pointer and reference.
- `dynamic_cast`: A pointer or reference to a base class type, safely converted to a derived class pointer or a reference.

Let's look at an example.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
 
struct V {
    virtual void f() {};
};
struct A : virtual V {};
struct B : virtual V {
  B(V* v, A* a) {
    // convert when construct
    dynamic_cast<B*>(v); // well defined: type of v is V*, V is the base class of B, it returns B*
    dynamic_cast<B*>(a); // undefined:    type of a is A*, A is not the base class of B
  }
};
struct D : A, B {
    D() : B((A*)this, this) { }
};
struct Base {
    virtual ~Base() {}
};
struct Derived: Base {
    virtual void name() {}
};
 
int main()
{
    D d; // derived class
    A& a = d;                       // upcast
    D& new_d = dynamic_cast<D&>(a); // downcast
    B& new_b = dynamic_cast<B&>(a); // sidecast


    Base* b1 = new Base;
    if(Derived* d = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(b1))
    {
        std::cout << "from b1 to d, downcast\n";
        d->name(); // safety invoke
    }

    Base* b2 = new Derived;
    if(Derived* d = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(b2))
    {
        std::cout << "from b2 to d, downcast\n";
        d->name(); // safety invoke
    }

    delete b1;
    delete b2;
}
```

The above code will only output `from b2 to d, downcase`.

First of all, we defined a type D derived class object, and D is derived from A and B.
Then we using a type A reference referenced a type D object, which is the typical behavior of **upcast** in C++.

However, a typical **downcast** in C++ means when using `dynamic_cast` converts a type A reference to its subclass object reference.

Moreover, when we say **sidecast**, it basically means to convert a parent class A, which reference to type D object, to another parent class B, which also reference type D object.

Then, b1 is a base pointer, it points to a base class object, and if we take is as a subclass object in runtime, and invoke its subclass object methods, it will causes unsafety invokation. Thus, the downcast from b1 to d won't successed.

For b2, which is also a base pointer, however it points to a derived class object, by using `dynamic_cast`, we can safely convert it to a derived class pointer and successfully call a derived class method.

## 3. Explicit Type Conversion in C++

Except `dynamic_cast`, explicit type conversion in C++ also contains `static_cast`, `const_cast` and `reinterpret_cast`.

`static_cast` is able to convert any type with a well-defined type, `static_cast` can be used as long as without any `const`.
Because of static type conversion, there is no runtime type conversion to ensure the security of the conversion.
The `const_cast` can only change the `const` property of the object, and can not change the type of an object when doing expression operation.
It can be used to increase or remove the const property of the object.
However, it's worth noting that the write behavior of the const attribute object removed by `const_cast` is undefined.

For instance,

```cpp
int *num;
const int *const_num;
void* p = &num;
int *static_cast_num = static_cast<int *>(p);
int *static_cast_num2 = static_cast<int *>(const_num); // wrong, can't convert const type
int *const_cast_num = const_cast<int *>(const_num);    // undefined
```

`reinterpret_cast` can provides re-interpret for bit patter of a memory address, for example:

```cpp
struct A {
    int a;
};
struct B {
    int b;
};
 
struct C : A, B {};

C c;
std::cout <<  &c << reinterpret_cast<B*>(&c) << static_cast<B*>(&c) << (B*)&c std::endl;
```

In the above code, our struct C inherits from A and B. When we cast the address of object c using `reinterpret_cast`, we re-interpret the entire block of memory directly, so its address is as same as the address of c. 
But` static_cast` will calculate the offset for the parent class pointer, converting c containing a, b into B* and pointing to b, which results in a different address for the final output. The result of a final C-style cast is as same as the `static_cast` result.

## 4. Summary

In this experiment, we reviewed the explicit type conversion in C++, where `static_cast` and `const_cast` are similar with C-style type conversion. However, `static_cast` can't convert a `const` object to a non `const` object forcely, in mean while, it gurantees the code safety. For `reinterpret_cast`, it provides a low-level type conversion and directly re-interpret the bit pattern of a memory address.

In our next experiment, we will start designing and implementing the high performance RTTI library we want.
