# Spring MVC Introduction

## 1. Introduction

Spring MVC is the original web framework built on the Servlet API and included in the Spring Framework. In this part, we'll talk about some basic concepts of Spring MVC and its processing flow.

### 2.1 What's Spring MVC

Spring MVC, like many other web frameworks, is designed around the front controller pattern where a central `Servlet`, the `DispatcherServlet`, provides a shared algorithm for request processing while actual work is performed by configurable, delegate components. This model is flexible and supports diverse workflows. Spring MVC also includes multiple view technologies, such as JSP, Velecity, Tiles, iText and POI, etc. Spring MVC makes functional segments for controller, model, dispatcher, handler. By this way, it makes customization for different parts very easy.

### 2.2 Spring MVC processing flow

Spring MVC consists of DispatcherServlet, Handler Mapping, Handler Adapter, Controller, View Resolver, View.

The work flow of Spring MVC seems like below:

![](Spring_MVC_flow.png)

(1). DispatcherServlet

Front controller ( or DispatcherServlet ), all requests from front pages are dispatched to corresponding handler by this  module.

(2). HandlerMapping

Resolve request url, and find corresponding class to handle the request.

(3). HandlerAdapter

Invoke a specific method to perform received user request.

(4). Controller

Controller will perform user request. After finishing the processing, it will return a ModelAndView object to DispatcherServlet.

(5). ViewResolver

Resolve a ModelAndView name as an actual View object, and extract Model out of ModelAndView.

## 3. Summary

This part, we mainly introduced some basic concepts of Spring MVC, you should understand them clearly, it's the basis for later study.
