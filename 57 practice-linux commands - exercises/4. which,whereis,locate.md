# Exercise 4 -which,whereis,locate

## 1.Experiment Introduction

#### 1.1 Experiment Content

This experiment will introduce the usage of which, whereis, and locate commands in Linux commands.

#### 1.2 Experimental Knowledge Points

- which Command
- whereis Command
- locate Command

#### 1.3 Experiment Environment

The experimental environment used in the course is Ubuntu Linux 14.04 64-bit version. The program will be used in the experiment:

- Xfce terminal

## 2.Experiment  Procedure
- which
- whereis
- locate
### 2.1 which Command

The role of the which command is to search for the location of the executable file in the path specified by the PATH variable. It is generally used to confirm whether the specified software is installed in the system.

**(1) Command Format**

> which executable file name

**(2) Common Examples**
**Example 1:** To confirm whether gcc is installed, use the following command:

```
which gcc
```

**Example 2:** To view the path of the cd command, use the following command:

```
which cd
```

![Alt text](https://dn-anything-about-doc.qbox.me/linuxcommand/which2.png)

From the above display information you can see in the labex system cd is a shell function.

Then execute the which cd command on my local linux system. The result is as follows:

![Alt text](https://dn-anything-about-doc.qbox.me/linuxcommand/which3.png)

There is no cd command displayed in the path specified by the PATH variable. Why is it not displayed? This is because cd is a shell built-in command, and which by default finds the directory specified in PATH. The built-in command is not in its specified directory, so of course it must not be found.

Then there is a problem, why cd is a shell function in the labex environment, and cd is a built-in command in other linux environment? This is related to the bash used.

The echo $SHELL command looks at the currently used shell.

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'which' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "which" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.2 Supplementary knowledge

What exactly is an order?

The command can be one of the following four forms:

1. Is an executable program, just like the file we have seen in the directory /usr/bin. Programs that fall into this category can be compiled into binary files, such as those written in C and C++, or programs written in scripting languages, such as shell, perl, python, ruby, and so on.
2. Is a command built into the shell itself. Bash supports several commands, internally called builtins. For example, the cd command in my local environment above is a shell internal command.
3. Is a shell function. These are small-scale shell scripts that are mixed into environment variables. For example, the cd command mentioned above is a shell function in the lab environment.
4. Is a command alias. We can define our own commands and build on other commands.
  The echo $SHELL command looks at the currently used shell.

### 2.3 whereis Command

The whereis command is mainly used to locate the executable file, source code file, and help file in the file system. The whereis command also has the ability to search for source code, specify an alternate search path, and search for unusual items.

The whereis command looks up very quickly because it isn't just looking around randomly on disk, but in a database (/var/lib/mlocate/). This database is automatically created by the Linux system, contains information on all local files, and is updated once every day by automatically executing the updatedb command. It is precisely because this database is updated once a day, it will make the search results of whereis command sometimes inaccurate, such as just added files may not be found.

**(1) Command Format**

> whereis [options] file

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -b        | Targeting executables                                        |
| -m        | Locate help file                                             |
| -s        | Locating source code files                                   |
| -u        | Searching for files other than executables, source files, and help files in the default path |
| -B        | Specify the path to the search executable                    |
| -M        | Specify the path to the search help file                     |
| -S        | Specify the path to the search source file                   |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example** 1: Search for the path to the gcc executable. You can use the following command:

```
whereis -b gcc
```

Example** 2: Search for the path to the gcc help file. You can use the following command:

```
whereis -m gcc
```

**Example 3:** Search for the path to the gcc source code. You can use the following command:

```
whereis -s gcc
```

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'whereis' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "whereis" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.4 locate Command

The locate command is similar to the whereis command and they use the same database. However, the whereis command can only search for executable files, online help files, and source code files. If you want more comprehensive search results, you can use the locate command.

The locate command uses a very complex matching syntax that uses special characters (such as '*' and '?') to specify which samples to look for.

**(1) Command Format**

locate [option](Search string)

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter | Description                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| -q        | Quiet mode, no error message is displayed |
| -n        | Display at most n outputs                 |
| -r        | Use regular expressions to do the search  |
| -V        | Display version message                   |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** To search for all files beginning with sh in the etc directory, use the following command:

```
locate /etc/sh
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/C/K/C/T0w6tipoQDZV.png)

Note that executing this command in the labex environment may result in an error: locate cannot be executed stat() `‘/var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db’`: There is no such file or directory. The solution is to execute the `sudo updatedb` command.

**Example** 2: Search for the file named lou in the etc directory. You can use the following command:

```
locate /etc/*lab*
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/H/K/D/zKZZEPeV1vkN.png)

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'locate' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "locate" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
