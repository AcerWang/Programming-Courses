## 1.Experiment Introduction

#### 1.1 Experiment Content

This experiment will introduce the usage of the df, du, and time commands in Linux commands.

#### 1.2 Experimental Knowledge Points

- df Command
- du Command
- time Command

#### **1.3 Experiment Environment**

The experimental environment used in the course is Ubuntu Linux 14.04 64-bit version. The program will be used in the experiment:

- Xfce terminal

## 2.Experiment  Procedure
- df
- du
- time
### 2.1 df Command

The function of the df command in linux is to check the disk space usage of the linux server's file system. You can use this command to find out how much space your hard disk is occupying, and how much space is left.

The df command is an acronym for disk free.

**(1) Command Format**

> df [option]  file

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter           | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -a                  | All file system list                                         |
| -h                  | Easy to read display                                         |
| -i                  | Show inode information                                       |
| -T                  | File system type                                             |
| -t<filesystem type> | Only show disk information for the selected file system      |
| -x<filesystem type> | Does not display disk information for the selected file system |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** To display the disk usage, use the following command:

```
df
```

**Example 2:** To display the disk usage in inode mode, you can use the following command:

```
df  -i
```

**Example 3:** To list the file system type, use the following command:

```
df  -T
```

**Example 4:** To display the specified type of disk, use the following command:

```
df  -tT ext4
```

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'df' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "df" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.2 du Command

The du command in Linux also looks at the space used, but unlike the df command, the Linux du command is used to view the space used by files and directory disks.

The du command is an acronym for disk usage.

**(1) Command Format**

> du  [option]  file

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -a        | Displays the size of individual files in the directory.      |
| -b        | When the directory or file size is displayed, it is in byte units. |
| -c        | In addition to displaying the size of individual directories or files, the sum of all directories or files is also displayed. |
| -k        | It is output in KB (1024bytes) units.                        |
| -m        | Output in megabytes.                                         |
| -s        | Only totals are displayed, only the last summed value is listed. |
| -h        | Improve the readability of information in units of K,M,G     |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** Display the space occupied by the specified file and display it in a format that is easy to read. You can use the following command:

```
du  -h  file1.txt
```

**Example 2:** Display the space occupied by the specified directory and display it in a format that is easy to read. You can use the following command:

```
du  -h  Desktop
```

**Example 3:** Displaying the size of the disk space occupied by several files or directories and summing the statistics, use the following command:

```
du -ch file1.txt file2.txt
```

**Example 4:** Sort the display in reverse order according to the space size, use the following command:

```
du  -h  | sort -nr | head -10
```

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'du' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "du" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### **2.3 time Comman**d

The time command is often used to measure the running time of a command, including the actual time, the process spent in user mode, and the process spent in kernel mode.

Actual time: The time from execution of the command command line to the end of the run.

User mode usage time: the user's CPU time spent to complete the command execution, that is, the sum of the execution time of commands in the user mode.

Kernel-state usage time: The system CPU time spent executing the command, that is, the sum of the execution time of the command in the core state.

**(1) Command Format**

> time command

**(2) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** To measure the running time of the date command, use the following command:

```
time date
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/W/W/Y/UKbjXXXSwAKt.png)

From the above results can be: the actual running time is 0.002s, the user cpu time is 0.000s, the system cpu time is 0.000s.

Among them, the sum of the user CPU time and the system CPU time is the CPU time, that is, the sum of the time the command occupies the CPU. The actual time is greater than the CPU time, because Linux is a multitasking operating system, and often the system has to deal with other tasks when executing a command.

**Example 2:** To save the execution result of the time command to a file, use the following command:

```
{ time date; } 2>1.txt
(time date) 2>2.txt
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/L/B/Y/5FWaDP6COr7m.png)

Time is the keyword of the shell. The shell does special processing. It will handle the command line behind the time command as a whole. In the redirection, it is actually for the following command, the output of the time command itself. Will not be redirected. For example, execute time date 2>3.txt, and the content of 3.txt is empty. In addition, the output of the time command is printed on the standard error output.

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'time' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "time" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
