This experiment will introduce the usage of the wc and grep commands in Linux commands.

#### 1.2 Experimental Knowledge Points

- wc Command
- grep Command


- Regular expression

#### **1.3 Experiment Environment**

The experimental environment used in the course is Ubuntu Linux 14.04 64-bit version. The program will be used in the experiment:

- Xfce terminal

## 2.Experiment  Procedure
- wc
- grep

### 2.1 wc Command

The wc command is a statistical tool that is used to display the number of lines, words, and bytes contained in a file.

The wc command is an abbreviation for word count.

**(1) Command Format**

> wc [option](file)

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -c        | Statistics bytes                                             |
| -l        | Statistics rows                                              |
| -m        | Number of characters counted. This flag cannot be used with the -c flag |
| -w        | The number of statistical words, a word is defined as a string separated by blanks, tabs or newline characters |
| -L        | Print the length of the longest line                         |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** Count the number of bytes, lines, and characters of a file. You can use the following command:

```
wc -c c.txt
wc -l c.txt
wc -m c.txt
```

One line break per line here is also a character, the word (32) + space (4) + line break (1) = 37.

**Example 2:** Count the number of bytes, lines, and characters of a file, print only numbers, and do not print the file name. You can use the following command:

```
cat c.txt | wc -c
cat c.txt | wc -l
cat c.txt | wc -m
```

**Example** 3: To count the number of commands in the /bin directory, use the following command:

```
ls /bin | wc -l
```

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'wc' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "wc" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.2 grep Command

Grep is a very powerful command for finding matching text in a file, accepting regular expressions and wildcards, and using multiple grep command options to generate output in various formats.

Grep works like this, searching for a string template in one or more files. If the template includes spaces, it must be referenced and all strings after the template are treated as file names. The search results are sent to the standard output without affecting the original file content.

Grep can be used for shell scripts because grep states the status of the search by returning a status value, 0 if the template search succeeded, 1 if the search was unsuccessful, and 2 if the searched file did not exist. We can use these return values to perform some automated text processing.

**(1) Command Format**

> grep [options] pattern [file]

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter    | Description                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| -c           | Calculate the number of 'search string' (ie pattern) found |
| -i           | Ignore case differences, so case is considered the same    |
| -n           | Output line number                                         |
| -v           | Reverse selection, print mismatched lines                  |
| -r           | Recursive search                                           |
| --color=anto | Add a color display to the found keyword section           |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** Take out the root line in the /etc/passwd file, and add the color to the keyword. You can use the following command:

```
grep "root" /etc/passwd --color=auto
cat /etc/passwd | grep "root" --color=auto
```

**Example 2:** To remove the root and nologin lines from the /etc/passwd file, use the following command:

```
grep -v "root" /etc/passwd | grep -v "nologin"
```

**Example 3:** In the current directory recursive search file contains main () file, often used to find some function in which source code file, you can use the following command:

```
grep -r "main()". head -10
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/X/L/R/E4i5z8KT6Ofl.png)

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'grep' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "grep" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.3  Regular expressions and grep commands

A regular expression is a symbolic representation that is used to identify text patterns. To some extent, they are similar to shell wildcards that match file and path names, but they are larger. Many command-line tools and most programming languages support regular expressions to help solve text manipulation problems.

Regular expression metacharacters consist of the following characters:

^ $ . [ ] { } - ? * + ( ) | \

| Regular expression | Description                                                  | Example                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ^                  | Line start marker                                            | ^labex matches rows starting with labex                      |
| $                  | End of line marker                                           | $labex matches rows ending with labex                        |
| .                  | Match any character                                          | a.c matches abc, aac but does not match abbc                 |
| []                 | Match any character contained in [Character]                 | ab[cd] matches abc or abd                                    |
| [^]                | Match any character except \[ ^ character]                   | 1\[^01] matches 12,13 but does not match 10,11               |
| [-]                | Match any character within the specified range               | [1-5] Match any number from 1 to 5                           |
| {n}                | Match the previous item n times                              | [0-9]{2} matches any two-digit number, which is equivalent to \[0-9][0-9] |
| {n,}               | The previous item needs to match at least n times            | [0-9]{2,} matches a digit with two or more digits            |
| {n,m}              | Specify the minimum and maximum number of times the previous item needs to match | [0-9]{2,5} matches any number from two digits to five digits |
| ?                  | Match the previous item 1 or 0 times                         | lab?ex matches labex, laex                                   |
| *                  | Match the previous item 0 or more times                      | lab*ex matches laex, labex, labeex                           |
| +                  | Match the previous item one or more times                    | lab+ex matches labex, labbex                                 |
| ()                 | Create a substring for matching                              | Ma(in)? matches ma or main                                   |
| &#124;             | Match &#124; Any of the two sides                            | Dec(1st &#124; 2nd) matches Dec 1st or Dec 2nd               |
| \                  | Escape special characters above                              | a\\+b matches a+b                                            |

**(1) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** Use the Linux system's own dictionary to find a five-letter word, the third letter is j, the last letter is r, /usr/share/dict directory to store the dictionary file,If you do not have a dictionary, you can create your own test file, you can use the following command:

```
grep '^..j.r$' linux.words
```

Example 2: Verify the fixed phone and print the eligible phone. The format of the fixed phone is basically the area code with 0 + connector "-" + phone number, and there may be an extension number, and the area code has 3, 4 digits. The phone number has 7 and 8 digits, you can use the following command:

```
grep "^0[0-9]{2,3}-[0-9]{7,8}(-[0-9]{3,4})?$" telphone.txt
```

Area code: preceding 0, followed by 2-3 digits: 0[0-9]{2,3}

Phone number: 7-8 digits: [0-9]{7,8}

Extension number: Generally 3-4 digits: [0-9]{3,4}

Note that there is no matching output when executing the following command. This is because without the -E option, why isn't this case? Why? This is because grep treats it as a shell wildcard, not a regular expression metacharacter.

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i '{|}|[|]|\$|\^' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use regular expression.
  timeout: 3
```
