# Exercise 5 -find,xargs

## 1.Experiment Introduction

#### 1.1 Experiment Content

This experiment will introduce the usage of the find and xargs commands in Linux commands.

#### 1.2 Experimental Knowledge Points

- find Command
- xargs Command

#### **1.3 Experiment Environment**

The experimental environment used in the course is Ubuntu Linux 14.04 64-bit version. The program will be used in the experiment:

- Xfce terminal

## 2.Experiment  Procedure
- find
- xargs

### 2.1 find Command(1)

The main function of the find command is to traverse down the file hierarchy, match the files that meet the conditions, and perform the corresponding operations. Under the Linux find command provides a lot of search conditions, the function is very powerful, the corresponding learning is also more difficult.

**(1) Command Format**

> find option [expression]

The default path is the current directory and the default expression is -print.

The expression may consist of the following components: operators, options, test expressions, and actions.

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter    | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -print       | Find command outputs matching files to standard output       |
| -exec        | The find command executes the shell command given for the matching file |
| -name        | Find files by file name                                      |
| -type        | Finding a type of file                                       |
| -prune       | Using this option to make the find command not lookup in the currently specified directory. If you use the -depth option, -prune will be ignored by the find command. |
| -user        | Find files by owner of the file                              |
| -group       | Find files by the group they belong to                       |
| -mtime -n +n | Find the file according to the file's change time, -n means the file change time is less than n days, +n means the file change time is now greater than n days, the find command also has -atime and -ctime options |

Other commands Command options and expressions can be seen in the figure below.

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** To print a list of file directories in the current directory, use the following command(Only the first 10 rows are displayed):

```
find  .  -print | head -10
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/E/K/F/TCqPrNLbo1k1.png)

**Example 2:** Print all the file names ending in .txt in the current directory, you can use the following command (the screenshot shows only part):

```
find  .  -name "*.txt" -print | head -10
```

The -iname option works the same as the -name option except that -iname ignores case letters.

**Example 3:** To print all file names ending with .txt or .pdf in the current directory, use the following command (screenshot shows only part):

```
find  .  \( -name "*.pdf" -or -name "*.txt" \)
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/I/B/B/hJ6D6m2onB4f.png)

**Example 4:** Print all file names in the current directory that do not end with .txt. You can use the following command:

```
find  .  ! -name "*.txt"
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/T/J/R/aHXQ8U8UrcF6.png)

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'find' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "find" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.2 find Command(2)

Here's how to find matching files based on file type, permissions, owner, and operator.

According to the file type to find the file, use the -type option, the common find file type is shown in the following table.

| File type | Description           |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| b         | Block device file     |
| c         | Character device file |
| d         | Directory             |
| f         | Ordinary file         |
| l         | Symbolic link         |

Find files based on file permissions using the -perm option. The owner uses the -user option.

In addition, the find command can create more complex logical relations through logical operators. For example, the operator -or is used in Example 3 of the find command (1). The logical operators for the find command are shown in the following table.

| Operators | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -and      | Matches if the test files on both sides of the operator are true. Can be abbreviated as -a. Note that -and is used by default if no operator is used |
| -or       | Match if any of the test conditions on both sides of the operator are true. Can be abbreviated as -o |
| -not      | Match if the test condition following the operator is false. Can be abbreviated as an exclamation point (!) |
| ()        | Combining test conditions and operators to form larger expressions. This will always control the logic calculation priority. By default, find commands are evaluated from left to right. It is often necessary to override the default job search order to get the desired result. Even if not necessary, sometimes including the combined characters is helpful for improving the readability of the command. Note that because parentheses have special meaning to the shell, when using them on the command line, they must be enclosed in parentheses before they can be passed as arguments to the find command. Usually backslash characters are used to escape parentheses |

**(1) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** To print all symbolic links ending in .txt in the current directory, use the following command:

```
find  .  -type l -name "*.txt" -print
```

**Example 2:** Print all php files with permissions of 777 in the current directory (php files on web servers generally need execute permission). You can use the following command:

```
find  .  -type f -name "*.php" -perm 777
```

**Example** 3: To print all files owned by the root user in the current directory, use the following command:

```
find  .  -type f -user root
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/H/F/B/3kLsrf8CrYXs.png)



**Example 4:** Print all files whose permissions under the current directory are not 777 and 664. You can use the following command:

```
find  .  -type f  \( ! -perm 777  -and  ! -perm 644 \)
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/F/F/N/4PSE9xk5ChcO.png)

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i '-type' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "-type" option.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.3 find Command(3)

The following describes how to use the -exec option of the find command to perform the specified action command on the found file.

**(1) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** To find all the php files in the current directory and display their detailed information, you can use the following command:

```
find . -name "*.php" -exec ls -l {} \;
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/B/T/P/J8HeRgieD6Ow.png)

-exec is the action that the find command performs on the found file. This action is to execute the command on the found file. The above command is ls -l {}. Here to explain {} and \;, {} It is actually a placeholder, in the implementation of the find command will continue to be replaced by the currently found file, which is equivalent to "ls -l found file". And \; is the end of the -exec command, because the command behind -exec must end with ; but; has a special meaning in the shell and must be escaped, so written as \;.

**Example 2:** In the labex environment, there are many c language code files written by ourselves. Now we want to download all the c language code files. If one or the other is very troublesome, we can find all the c language code files first, and then Write the contents of these files to a file, download the file, you can use the following command:

```
find . -name "*.c" -exec cat {} \; > all.c
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/O/C/C/6wvSIGIp6XHk.png)



**Example 3:** By default, only one command can be used after -exec. If you want multiple commands, you can write multiple commands to the script file. Then use this script in -exec. You can use the following command:

```
find . -name "*.c" -exec ./command.sh {} \;
```

Script content:

```
#ÔºÅ /bin/bash
ls -l $1       # $1 Indicates the first parameter
cat $1
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/O/D/N/I3dnLhrqyjIt.png)

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i '-name' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "-name" option.
  timeout: 3
```
### xargs Command

We can use pipe to redirect stdout (standard output) of one command to stdin (standard input) of another command. However, some commands can only receive data in the form of command line parameters and cannot receive data streams through stdin. In this case, data cannot be redirected to these commands through pipes.

In this case, xargs can play its role. The xargs command can receive input from standard input and convert the input to a specific parameter list.

**(1) Command Format**

command  | xargs [Options](command) 

The xargs command should immediately follow the pipeline operator because it uses the standard input as the primary source data stream.

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter | Description                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| -n        | Specify the maximum number of parameters per row |
| -d        | Specify separator                                |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** Converting multi-line input to single-line output can use the following command:

```
cat a.txt | xargs
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/Q/Y/T/oiYWK02z6AsL.png)

**Example 2:** To convert a single-line input to multiple lines of output, use the following command:

```
echo "1 2 3 4 5 6 7" | xargs -n 3
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/C/J/B/pvL0lJLmCsew.png)

**Example 3:** Convert single-line input to multi-line output. Specify the separator as i. You can use the following command:

```
cat b.txt | xargs -d i -n 3
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/X/I/Y/EJLI16DPAsCY.png)

**Example 4:** Find all c code files in the current directory and count the total number of lines. You can use the following command:

```
find . -type f -name "*.c" | xargs wc -l
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/N/B/J/rzJtQJUANBhh.png)

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'xargs' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "xargs" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
