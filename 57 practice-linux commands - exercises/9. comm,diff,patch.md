# Exercise 9 -comm,diff,patch

## 1.Experiment Introduction

#### 1.1 Experiment Content

This expriment will introduce the usage of the comm, diff, and patch commands in Linux commands.

#### 1.2 Experimental Knowledge Points

- comm Command
- diff Command
- patch Command

#### **1.3 Experiment Environment**

The experimental environment used in the course is Ubuntu Linux 14.04 64-bit version. The program will be used in the experiment:

- Xfce terminal

## 2.Experiment  Procedure
- comm
- diff
- patch
### 2.1 comm Command

It is often helpful to compare the contents of text files. This is especially important for system administrators and software developers. A system administrator may, for example, need to compare existing configuration files with previous versions to diagnose a system error. Similarly, a programmer often needs to check the program's changes.

The comm command will compare the two files already sorted line by line. The display consists of 3 columns: Column 1 is the row found only in the first file, Column 2 is the row found only in the second file, and Column 3 is the common row of both files.

Note that the comm command, like the join and uniq commands, can only be used for data that has already been sorted.

**(1) Command Format**

> comm  [option] file 1  file 2

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter | Description                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| -1        | Does not output file 1 unique lines      |
| -2        | Do not output file 2 unique lines        |
| -3        | Do not output lines common to both files |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** Compare the contents of file1.txt and file2.txt and use the following command:

```
comm  file1.txt  file2.txt
```

**Example 2:** Compare the contents of two files, file1.txt and file2.txt, to display only the contents of the two files. Use the following command:

```
comm  -12 file1.txt  file2.txt
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/D/R/R/847Ul7LXXpKc.png)

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'comm' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "comm" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.2 diff Command

Like the comm command, the diff command is used to monitor the differences between files. However, diff is a more sophisticated tool that supports many output formats and can handle many text files at a time. Software developers often use the diff program to check for changes between source code versions of different programs. Diff can recursively examine the source directory, often referred to as the source tree. A common use case for diff programs is to create a diff file or patch that will be used by other programs, such as the patch program (which we'll talk about later) to convert files from one version to another.

Diff prints every line change on the command line, and diff is an integral part of version control tools such as svn, cvs, git, and so on.

The diff command is an abbreviation for differential.

**(1) Command Format**

> diff  [option]  file

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -c        | Context mode, showing all the text and marking out differences |
| -u        | Unified mode to display different contents of files in a consolidated manner |
| -a        | Only text files will be compared line by line                |
| -N        | When comparing directories, if file A only appears in a directory, the default is: Only in directory. If you use the -N parameter, diff compares file A with a blank file |
| -r        | Recursively compare files under a directory                  |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** Display the difference between file1.txt and file2.txt. You can use the following command:

```
diff  file1.txt  file2.txt
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/N/I/X/i1UzJiUrxFqM.png)

"1d0" in the above result display indicates that the file1.txt file has the first line more than the file2.txt file, and "4c3,4" indicates that the fourth line of the file1.txt file is different from the third and fourth lines of the file2.txt file. .

There are three tips for the diff's normal display format:

- a - add
- c - change
- d - delete

**Example 2:** From the display result of the above example one, we can know that the difference between the two files file1.txt and file2.txt is not easy to see, you can use the context mode display, you can use the following command:

```
diff  -c file1.txt  file2.txt
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/Y/V/H/Gu7ItSdbVfAw.png)

This output begins with two file names and their time stamps. The first file is marked with an asterisk, and the second file is marked with a dash. Throughout the rest of the list, these tags will represent the files they represent.

```
*** 1,4 *** Indicates the first to fourth line of text in the first file.
```

```
--- 1, 4 --- Represents the first to fourth lines of text in the second file.
```

Three special characters:

**\+** Add line, this line will appear in the second file, not the first file

**\-** Delete line, this line will appear in the first file, not in the second file

**\!** Change the line, two versions of a text line will be displayed, each version will appear in the respective part of the change group

These special characters are easy to confuse, and you can actually remember one thing at a time: The purpose of all operations is to turn the first file into a second file.

**Example 3:** Check the differences between the two files, file1.txt and file2.txt. Use the unified mode to display the following commands:

```
diff  -u file1.txt  file2.txt
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/W/N/E/zP9NGAheg0QB.png)

The most significant difference between context mode and unified mode is the elimination of duplicated contexts, which makes the output of unified mode shorter than the output of context mode.

@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@ Indicates the line of text in the first file described in the change group and the line of text in the second file.

Special characters:

- \+ Add this line to the first file
- \- Delete this line in the first file

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'diff' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "diff" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
### 2.3 patch Command

The patch command is used to apply the changes to the text file. It accepts output from the diff program and is usually used to convert older file versions to newer file versions. Let us consider a well-known example. The Linux kernel was developed by a large, loosely-organized team of contributors who submitted a fixed number of changes to the source package. This Linux kernel is made up of millions of lines of code, though each contributor makes very few changes each time. For a contributor, it makes no sense to send the entire kernel source tree to each developer for every modification. Instead, submit a diff file. A diff file contains the difference between the previous kernel version and the new version with contributor modifications. A recipient then uses the patch program to apply these changes to his own source tree. Using the diff/patch combination provides two major advantages:

1.A diff file is very small, compared to the size of the entire source tree.

2.A diff file succinctly shows the changes, allowing reviewers of program patches to quickly evaluate it.

Of course, diff/patch works on any text file, not just source files. It also applies to configuration files or any other text.

Prepare a diff file for the patch command. The GNU documentation recommends using the diff command like so:

```
diff  -Naur old_file new_file > diff_file
```

The old file and new file sections are not single files or directories that contain files. This r option supports recursive directory trees.

**(1) Command Format**

> patch [options] patch file

**(2) Common Parameters**

| Parameter | Description                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| -p num    | Ignore several layers of folders     |
| -E        | If you find an empty file, delete it |
| -R        | Canceled patches                     |

**(3) Common Examples**

**Example 1:** Generate the diff file of file1.txt and file2.txt, and then use the patch command to update the file1.txt file. You can use the following command:

```
diff  -Naur file1.txt  file2.txt > patchdiff.txt
patch < patchdiff.txt
```

**Example 2:** To cancel the patch played in the above example, you can use the following command:

```
patch -R < patchdiff.txt
```

![image desc](https://labex.io/upload/D/P/X/VXzaijqn92we.png)

```checker
- name: check if content exist
  script: |
    #!/bin/bash
    grep -i 'patch' /home/labex/.zsh_history
  error: Sorry, you didn't use "patch" cmd.
  timeout: 3
```
